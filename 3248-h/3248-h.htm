      PREFACE
    </h2>
    <p>
      The measure of a man's power to help his brother is the measure of the
      love in the heart of him and of the faith he has that at last the good
      will win. With this love that seeks not its own and this faith that grips
      the heart of things, he goes out to meet many fortunes, but not that of
      defeat.
    </p>
    <p>
      This story is of the people of the Foothill Country; of those men of
      adventurous spirit, who left homes of comfort, often of luxury, because of
      the stirring in them to be and to do some worthy thing; and of those
      others who, outcast from their kind, sought to find in these valleys,
      remote and lonely, a spot where they could forget and be forgotten.
    </p>
    <p>
      The waving skyline of the Foothills was the boundary of their lookout upon
      life. Here they dwelt safe from the scanning of the world, freed from all
      restraints of social law, denied the gentler influences of home and the
      sweet uplift of a good woman's face. What wonder if, with the new freedom
      beating in their hearts and ears, some rode fierce and hard the wild trail
      to the cut-bank of destruction!
    </p>
    <p>
      The story is, too, of how a man with vision beyond the waving skyline came
      to them with firm purpose to play the brother's part, and by sheer love of
      them and by faith in them, win them to believe that life is priceless, and
      that it is good to be a man.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER I
    </h2>
    <h3>
      THE FOOTHILLS COUNTRY
    </h3>
    <p>
      Beyond the great prairies and in the shadow of the Rockies lie the
      Foothills. For nine hundred miles the prairies spread themselves out in
      vast level reaches, and then begin to climb over softly rounded mounds
      that ever grow higher and sharper till, here and there, they break into
      jagged points and at last rest upon the great bases of the mighty
      mountains. These rounded hills that join the prairies to the mountains
      form the Foothill Country. They extend for about a hundred miles only, but
      no other hundred miles of the great West are so full of interest and
      romance. The natural features of the country combine the beauties of
      prairie and of mountain scenery. There are valleys so wide that the
      farther side melts into the horizon, and uplands so vast as to suggest the
      unbroken prairie. Nearer the mountains the valleys dip deep and ever
      deeper till they narrow into canyons through which mountain torrents pour
      their blue-gray waters from glaciers that lie glistening between the white
      peaks far away. Here are the great ranges on which feed herds of cattle
      and horses. Here are the homes of the ranchmen, in whose wild, free,
      lonely existence there mingles much of the tragedy and comedy, the humor
      and pathos, that go to make up the romance of life. Among them are to be
      found the most enterprising, the most daring, of the peoples of the old
      lands. The broken, the outcast, the disappointed, these too have found
      their way to the ranches among the Foothills. A country it is whose sunlit
      hills and shaded valleys reflect themselves in the lives of its people;
      for nowhere are the contrasts of light and shade more vividly seen than in
      the homes of the ranchmen of the Albertas.
    </p>
    <p>
      The experiences of my life have confirmed in me the orthodox conviction
      that Providence sends his rain upon the evil as upon the good; else I
      should never have set my eyes upon the Foothill country, nor touched its
      strangely fascinating life, nor come to know and love the most striking
      man of all that group of striking men of the Foothill country&mdash;the
      dear old Pilot, as we came to call him long afterwards. My first year in
      college closed in gloom. My guardian was in despair. From this distance of
      years I pity him. Then I considered him unnecessarily concerned about me&mdash;&ldquo;a
      fussy old hen,&rdquo; as one of the boys suggested. The invitation from Jack
      Dale, a distant cousin, to spend a summer with him on his ranch in South
      Alberta came in the nick of time. I was wild to go. My guardian hesitated
      long; but no other solution of the problem of my disposal offering, he
      finally agreed that I could not well get into more trouble by going than
      by staying. Hence it was that, in the early summer of one of the eighties,
      I found myself attached to a Hudson's Bay Company freight train, making
      our way from a little railway town in Montana towards the Canadian
      boundary. Our train consisted of six wagons and fourteen yoke of oxen,
      with three cayuses, in charge of a French half-breed and his son, a lad of
      about sixteen. We made slow enough progress, but every hour of the long
      day, from the dim, gray, misty light of dawn to the soft glow of shadowy
      evening, was full of new delights to me. On the evening of the third day
      we reached the Line Stopping Place, where Jack Dale met us. I remember
      well how my heart beat with admiration of the easy grace with which he
      sailed down upon us in the loose-jointed cowboy style, swinging his own
      bronco and the little cayuse he was leading for me into the circle of the
      wagons, careless of ropes and freight and other impedimenta. He flung
      himself off before his bronco had come to a stop, and gave me a grip that
      made me sure of my welcome. It was years since he had seen a man from
      home, and the eager joy in his eyes told of long days and nights of lonely
      yearning for the old days and the old faces. I came to understand this
      better after my two years' stay among these hills that have a strange
      power on some days to waken in a man longings that make his heart grow
      sick. When supper was over we gathered about the little fire, while Jack
      and the half-breed smoked and talked. I lay on my back looking up at the
      pale, steady stars in the deep blue of the cloudless sky, and listened in
      fullness of contented delight to the chat between Jack and the driver. Now
      and then I asked a question, but not too often. It is a listening silence
      that draws tales from a western man, not vexing questions. This much I had
      learned already from my three days' travel. So I lay and listened, and the
      tales of that night are mingled with the warm evening lights and the pale
      stars and the thoughts of home that Jack's coming seemed to bring.
    </p>
    <p>
      Next morning before sun-up we had broken camp and were ready for our
      fifty-mile ride. There was a slight drizzle of rain and, though rain and
      shine were alike to him, Jack insisted that I should wear my mackintosh.
      This garment was quite new and had a loose cape which rustled as I moved
      toward my cayuse. He was an ugly-looking little animal, with more white in
      his eye than I cared to see. Altogether, I did not draw toward him. Nor
      did he to me, apparently. For as I took him by the bridle he snorted and
      sidled about with great swiftness, and stood facing me with his feet
      planted firmly in front of him as if prepared to reject overtures of any
      kind soever. I tried to approach him with soothing words, but he
      persistently backed away until we stood looking at each other at the
      utmost distance of his outstretched neck and my outstretched arm. At this
      point Jack came to my assistance, got the pony by the other side of the
      bridle, and held him fast till I got into position to mount. Taking a firm
      grip of the horn of the Mexican saddle, I threw my leg over his back. The
      next instant I was flying over his head. My only emotion was one of
      surprise, the thing was so unexpected. I had fancied myself a fair rider,
      having had experience of farmers' colts of divers kinds, but this was
      something quite new. The half-breed stood looking on, mildly interested;
      Jack was smiling, but the boy was grinning with delight.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'll take the little beast,&rdquo; said Jack. But the grinning boy braced me up
      and I replied as carelessly as my shaking voice would allow:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I guess I'll manage him,&rdquo; and once more got into position. But no
      sooner had I got into the saddle than the pony sprang straight up into the
      air and lit with his back curved into a bow, his four legs gathered
      together and so absolutely rigid that the shock made my teeth rattle. It
      was my first experience of &ldquo;bucking.&rdquo; Then the little brute went seriously
      to work to get rid of the rustling, flapping thing on his back. He would
      back steadily for some seconds, then, with two or three forward plunges,
      he would stop as if shot and spring straight into the upper air, lighting
      with back curved and legs rigid as iron. Then he would walk on his hind
      legs for a few steps, then throw himself with amazing rapidity to one side
      and again proceed to buck with vicious diligence.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Stick to him!&rdquo; yelled Jack, through his shouts of laughter. &ldquo;You'll make
      him sick before long.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I remember thinking that unless his insides were somewhat more delicately
      organized than his external appearance would lead one to suppose the
      chances were that the little brute would be the last to succumb to
      sickness. To make matters worse, a wilder jump than ordinary threw my cape
      up over my head, so that I was in complete darkness. And now he had me at
      his mercy, and he knew no pity. He kicked and plunged and reared and
      bucked, now on his front legs, now on his hind legs, often on his knees,
      while I, in the darkness, could only cling to the horn of the saddle. At
      last, in one of the gleams of light that penetrated the folds of my
      enveloping cape, I found that the horn had slipped to his side, so the
      next time he came to his knees I threw myself off. I am anxious to make
      this point clear, for, from the expression of triumph on the face of the
      grinning boy, and his encomiums of the pony, I gathered that he scored a
      win for the cayuse. Without pause that little brute continued for some
      seconds to buck and plunge even after my dismounting, as if he were some
      piece of mechanism that must run down before it could stop.
    </p>
    <p>
      By this time I was sick enough and badly shaken in my nerve, but the
      triumphant shouts and laughter of the boy and the complacent smiles on the
      faces of Jack and the half-breed stirred my wrath. I tore off the cape
      and, having got the saddle put right, seized Jack's riding whip and,
      disregarding his remonstrances, sprang on my steed once more, and before
      he could make up his mind as to his line of action plied him so vigorously
      with the rawhide that he set off over the prairie at full gallop, and in a
      few minutes came round to the camp quite subdued, to the boy's great
      disappointment and to my own great surprise. Jack was highly pleased, and
      even the stolid face of the half-breed showed satisfaction.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don't think I put this up on you,&rdquo; Jack said. &ldquo;It was that cape. He ain't
      used to such frills. But it was a circus,&rdquo; he added, going off into a fit
      of laughter, &ldquo;worth five dollars any day.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You bet!&rdquo; said the half-breed. &ldquo;Dat's make pretty beeg fun, eh?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It seemed to me that it depended somewhat upon the point of view, but I
      merely agreed with him, only too glad to be so well out of the fight.
    </p>
    <p>
      All day we followed the trail that wound along the shoulders of the
      round-topped hills or down their long slopes into the wide, grassy
      valleys. Here and there the valleys were cut through by coulees through
      which ran swift, blue-gray rivers, clear and icy cold, while from the
      hilltops we caught glimpses of little lakes covered with wild-fowl that
      shrieked and squawked and splashed, careless of danger. Now and then we
      saw what made a black spot against the green of the prairie, and Jack told
      me it was a rancher's shack. How remote from the great world, and how
      lonely it seemed!&mdash;this little black shack among these multitudinous
      hills.
    </p>
    <p>
      I shall never forget the summer evening when Jack and I rode into Swan
      Creek. I say into&mdash;but the village was almost entirely one of
      imagination, in that it consisted of the Stopping Place, a long log
      building, a story and a half high, with stables behind, and the store in
      which the post-office was kept and over which the owner dwelt. But the
      situation was one of great beauty. On one side the prairie rambled down
      from the hills and then stretched away in tawny levels into the misty
      purple at the horizon; on the other it clambered over the round, sunny
      tops to the dim blue of the mountains beyond.
    </p>
    <p>
      In this world, where it is impossible to reach absolute values, we are
      forced to hold things relatively, and in contrast with the long, lonely
      miles of our ride during the day these two houses, with their
      outbuildings, seemed a center of life. Some horses were tied to the rail
      that ran along in front of the Stopping Place.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hello!&rdquo; said Jack, &ldquo;I guess the Noble Seven are in town.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And who are they?&rdquo; I asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; he replied, with a shrug, &ldquo;they are the elite Of Swan Creek; and by
      Jove,&rdquo; he added, &ldquo;this must be a Permit Night.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What does that mean?&rdquo; I asked, as we rode up towards the tie rail.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said Jack, in a low tone, for some men were standing about the
      door, &ldquo;you see, this is a prohibition country, but when one of the boys
      feels as if he were going to have a spell of sickness he gets a permit to
      bring in a few gallons for medicinal purposes; and of course, the other
      boys being similarly exposed, he invites them to assist him in taking
      preventive measures. And,&rdquo; added Jack, with a solemn wink, &ldquo;it is
      remarkable, in a healthy country like this, how many epidemics come near
      ketching us.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And with this mystifying explanation we joined the mysterious company of
      the Noble Seven.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER II
    </h2>
    <h3>
      THE COMPANY OF THE NOBLE SEVEN
    </h3>
    <p>
      As we were dismounting, the cries, &ldquo;Hello, Jack!&rdquo; &ldquo;How do, Dale?&rdquo; &ldquo;Hello,
      old Smoke!&rdquo; in the heartiest of tones, made me see that my cousin was a
      favorite with the men grouped about the door. Jack simply nodded in reply
      and then presented me in due form. &ldquo;My tenderfoot cousin from the effete,&rdquo;
       he said, with a flourish. I was surprised at the grace of the bows made me
      by these roughly-dressed, wild-looking fellows. I might have been in a
      London drawing-room. I was put at my ease at once by the kindliness of
      their greeting, for, upon Jack's introduction, I was admitted at once into
      their circle, which, to a tenderfoot, was usually closed.
    </p>
    <p>
      What a hardy-looking lot they were! Brown, spare, sinewy and hard as
      nails, they appeared like soldiers back from a hard campaign. They moved
      and spoke with an easy, careless air of almost lazy indifference, but
      their eyes had a trick of looking straight out at you, cool and fearless,
      and you felt they were fit and ready.
    </p>
    <p>
      That night I was initiated into the Company of the Noble Seven&mdash;but
      of the ceremony I regret to say I retain but an indistinct memory; for
      they drank as they rode, hard and long, and it was only Jack's care that
      got me safely home that night.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Company of the Noble Seven was the dominant social force in the Swan
      Creek country. Indeed, it was the only social force Swan Creek knew.
      Originally consisting of seven young fellows of the best blood of Britain,
      &ldquo;banded together for purposes of mutual improvement and social enjoyment,&rdquo;
       it had changed its character during the years, but not its name. First,
      its membership was extended to include &ldquo;approved colonials,&rdquo; such as Jack
      Dale and &ldquo;others of kindred spirit,&rdquo; under which head, I suppose, the two
      cowboys from the Ashley Ranch, Hi Keadal and &ldquo;Bronco&rdquo; Bill&mdash;no one
      knew and no one asked his other name&mdash;were admitted. Then its
      purposes gradually limited themselves to those of a social nature, chiefly
      in the line of poker-playing and whisky-drinking. Well born and delicately
      bred in that atmosphere of culture mingled with a sturdy common sense and
      a certain high chivalry which surrounds the stately homes of Britain,
      these young lads, freed from the restraints of custom and surrounding,
      soon shed all that was superficial in their make-up and stood forth in the
      naked simplicity of their native manhood. The West discovered and revealed
      the man in them, sometimes to their honor, often to their shame. The Chief
      of the Company was the Hon. Fred Ashley, of the Ashley Ranch, sometime of
      Ashley Court, England&mdash;a big, good-natured man with a magnificent
      physique, a good income from home, and a beautiful wife, the Lady
      Charlotte, daughter of a noble English family. At the Ashley Ranch the
      traditions of Ashley Court were preserved as far as possible. The Hon.
      Fred appeared at the wolf-hunts in riding-breeches and top boots, with
      hunting crop and English saddle, while in all the appointments of the
      house the customs of the English home were observed. It was
      characteristic, however, of western life that his two cowboys, Hi Kendal
      and Bronco Bill, felt themselves quite his social equals, though in the
      presence of his beautiful, stately wife they confessed that they &ldquo;rather
      weakened.&rdquo; Ashley was a thoroughly good fellow, well up to his work as a
      cattle-man, and too much of a gentleman to feel, much less assert, any
      superiority of station. He had the largest ranch in the country and was
      one of the few men making money.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ashley's chief friend, or, at least, most frequent companion, was a man
      whom they called &ldquo;The Duke.&rdquo; No one knew his name, but every one said he
      was &ldquo;the son of a lord,&rdquo; and certainly from his style and bearing he might
      be the son of almost anything that was high enough in rank. He drew &ldquo;a
      remittance,&rdquo; but, as that was paid through Ashley, no one knew whence it
      came nor how much it was. He was a perfect picture of a man, and in all
      western virtues was easily first. He could rope a steer, bunch cattle,
      play poker or drink whisky to the admiration of his friends and the
      confusion of his foes, of whom he had a few; while as to &ldquo;bronco busting,&rdquo;
       the virtue par excellence of western cattle-men, even Bronco Bill was
      heard to acknowledge that &ldquo;he wasn't in it with the Dook, for it was his
      opinion that he could ride anythin' that had legs in under it, even if it
      was a blanked centipede.&rdquo; And this, coming from one who made a profession
      of &ldquo;bronco busting,&rdquo; was unquestionably high praise. The Duke lived alone,
      except when he deigned to pay a visit to some lonely rancher who, for the
      marvellous charm of his talk, was delighted to have him as guest, even at
      the expense of the loss of a few games at poker. He made a friend of no
      one, though some men could tell of times when he stood between them and
      their last dollar, exacting only the promise that no mention should be
      made of his deed. He had an easy, lazy manner and a slow cynical smile
      that rarely left his face, and the only sign of deepening passion in him
      was a little broadening of his smile. Old Latour, who kept the Stopping
      Place, told me how once The Duke had broken into a gentle laugh. A French
      half-breed freighter on his way north had entered into a game of poker
      with The Duke, with the result that his six months' pay stood in a little
      heap at his enemy's left hand. The enraged freighter accused his smiling
      opponent of being a cheat, and was proceeding to demolish him with one
      mighty blow. But The Duke, still smiling, and without moving from his
      chair, caught the descending fist, slowly crushed the fingers open, and
      steadily drew the Frenchman to his knees, gripping him so cruelly in the
      meantime that he was forced to cry aloud in agony for mercy. Then it was
      that The Duke broke into a light laugh and, touching the kneeling
      Frenchman on his cheek with his finger-tips, said: &ldquo;Look here, my man, you
      shouldn't play the game till you know how to do it and with whom you
      play.&rdquo; Then, handing him back the money, he added: &ldquo;I want money, but not
      yours.&rdquo; Then, as he sat looking at the unfortunate wretch dividing his
      attention between his money and his bleeding fingers, he once more broke
      into a gentle laugh that was not good to hear.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Duke was by all odds the most striking figure in the Company of the
      Noble Seven, and his word went farther than that of any other. His shadow
      was Bruce, an Edinburgh University man, metaphysical, argumentative,
      persistent, devoted to The Duke. Indeed, his chief ambition was to attain
      to The Duke's high and lordly manner; but, inasmuch as he was rather squat
      in figure and had an open, good-natured face and a Scotch voice of the
      hard and rasping kind, his attempts at imitation were not conspicuously
      successful. Every mail that reached Swan Creek brought him a letter from
      home. At first, after I had got to know him, he would give me now and then
      a letter to read, but as the tone became more and more anxious he ceased
      to let me read them, and I was glad enough of this. How he could read
      those letters and go the pace of the Noble Seven I could not see. Poor
      Bruce! He had good impulses, a generous heart, but the &ldquo;Permit&rdquo; nights and
      the hunts and the &ldquo;roundups&rdquo; and the poker and all the wild excesses of
      the Company were more than he could stand.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then there were the two Hill brothers, the younger, Bertie, a fair-haired,
      bright-faced youngster, none too able to look after himself, but much
      inclined to follies of all degrees and sorts. But he was warm-hearted and
      devoted to his big brother, Humphrey, called &ldquo;Hump,&rdquo; who had taken to
      ranching mainly with the idea of looking after his younger brother. And no
      easy matter that was, for every one liked the lad and in consequence
      helped him down.
    </p>
    <p>
      In addition to these there were two others of the original seven, but by
      force of circumstances they were prevented from any more than a nominal
      connection with the Company. Blake, a typical wild Irishman, had joined
      the police at the Fort, and Gifford had got married and, as Bill said,
      &ldquo;was roped tighter'n a steer.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Noble Company, with the cowboys that helped on the range and two or
      three farmers that lived nearer the Fort, composed the settlers of the
      Swan Creek country. A strange medley of people of all ranks and nations,
      but while among them there were the evil-hearted and evil-living, still,
      for the Noble Company I will say that never have I fallen in with men
      braver, truer, or of warmer heart. Vices they had, all too apparent and
      deadly, but they were due rather to the circumstances of their lives than
      to the native tendencies of their hearts. Throughout that summer and the
      winter following I lived among them, camping on the range with them and
      sleeping in their shacks, bunching cattle in summer and hunting wolves in
      winter, nor did I, for I was no wiser than they, refuse my part on
      &ldquo;Permit&rdquo; nights; but through all not a man of them ever failed to be true
      to his standard of honor in the duties of comradeship and brotherhood.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER III
    </h2>
    <h3>
      THE COMING OF THE PILOT
    </h3>
    <p>
      He was the first missionary ever seen in the country, and it was the Old
      Timer who named him. The Old Timer's advent to the Foothill country was
      prehistoric, and his influence was, in consequence, immense. No one
      ventured to disagree with him, for to disagree with the Old Timer was to
      write yourself down a tenderfoot, which no one, of course, cared to do. It
      was a misfortune which only time could repair to be a new-comer, and it
      was every new-comer's aim to assume with all possible speed the style and
      customs of the aristocratic Old Timers, and to forget as soon as possible
      the date of his own arrival. So it was as &ldquo;The Sky Pilot,&rdquo; familiarly &ldquo;The
      Pilot,&rdquo; that the missionary went for many a day in the Swan Creek country.
    </p>
    <p>
      I had become schoolmaster of Swan Creek. For in the spring a kind
      Providence sent in the Muirs and the Bremans with housefuls of children,
      to the ranchers' disgust, for they foresaw ploughed fields and barbed-wire
      fences cramping their unlimited ranges. A school became necessary. A
      little log building was erected and I was appointed schoolmaster. It was
      as schoolmaster that I first came to touch The Pilot, for the letter which
      the Hudson Bay freighters brought me early one summer evening bore the
      inscription:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     The Schoolmaster,
               Public School,
                        Swan Creek,
                                 Alberta.
</pre>
    <p>
      There was altogether a fine air about the letter; the writing was in fine,
      small hand, the tone was fine, and there was something fine in the
      signature&mdash;&ldquo;Arthur Wellington Moore.&rdquo; He was glad to know that there
      was a school and a teacher in Swan Creek, for a school meant children, in
      whom his soul delighted; and in the teacher he would find a friend, and
      without a friend he could not live. He took me into his confidence,
      telling me that though he had volunteered for this far-away mission field
      he was not much of a preacher and he was not at all sure that he would
      succeed. But he meant to try, and he was charmed at the prospect of having
      one sympathizer at least. Would I be kind enough to put up in some
      conspicuous place the enclosed notice, filling in the blanks as I thought
      best?
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
      &ldquo;Divine service will be held at Swan creek
       in &mdash;&mdash; &mdash;&mdash;- at &mdash;&mdash; o'clock.
          All are cordially invited.
                    Arthur Wellington Moore.&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      On the whole I liked his letter. I liked its modest self-depreciation and
      I liked its cool assumption of my sympathy and co-operation. But I was
      perplexed. I remembered that Sunday was the day fixed for the great
      baseball match, when those from &ldquo;Home,&rdquo; as they fondly called the land
      across the sea from which they had come, were to &ldquo;wipe the earth&rdquo; with all
      comers. Besides, &ldquo;Divine service&rdquo; was an innovation in Swan Creek and I
      felt sure that, like all innovations that suggested the approach of the
      East, it would be by no means welcome.
    </p>
    <p>
      However, immediately under the notice of the &ldquo;Grand Baseball Match for
      'The Pain Killer' a week from Sunday, at 2:30, Home vs. the World,&rdquo; I
      pinned on the door of the Stopping Place the announcement:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Divine service will be held at Swan Creek, in the Stopping Place Parlor,
      a week from Sunday, immediately upon the conclusion of the baseball match.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Arthur Wellington Moore.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There was a strange incongruity in the two, and an unconscious challenge
      as well.
    </p>
    <p>
      All next day, which was Saturday, and, indeed, during the following week,
      I stood guard over my notice, enjoying the excitement it produced and the
      comments it called forth. It was the advance wave of the great ocean of
      civilization which many of them had been glad to leave behind&mdash;some
      could have wished forever.
    </p>
    <p>
      To Robert Muir, one of the farmers newly arrived, the notice was a
      harbinger of good. It stood for progress, markets and a higher price for
      land; albeit he wondered &ldquo;hoo he wad be keepit up.&rdquo; But his hard-wrought,
      quick-spoken little wife at his elbow &ldquo;hooted&rdquo; his scruples and, thinking
      of her growing lads, welcomed with unmixed satisfaction the coming of &ldquo;the
      meenister.&rdquo; Her satisfaction was shared by all the mothers and most of the
      fathers in the settlement; but by the others, and especially by that
      rollicking, roistering crew, the Company of the Noble Seven, the
      missionary's coming was viewed with varying degrees of animosity. It meant
      a limitation of freedom in their wildly reckless living. The &ldquo;Permit&rdquo;
       nights would now, to say the least, be subject to criticism; the Sunday
      wolf-hunts and horse-races, with their attendant delights, would now be
      pursued under the eye of the Church, and this would not add to the
      enjoyment of them. One great charm of the country, which Bruce, himself
      the son of an Edinburgh minister, and now Secretary of the Noble Seven,
      described as &ldquo;letting a fellow do as he blanked pleased,&rdquo; would be gone.
      None resented more bitterly than he the missionary's intrusion, which he
      declared to be an attempt &ldquo;to reimpose upon their freedom the trammels of
      an antiquated and bigoted conventionality.&rdquo; But the rest of the Company,
      while not taking so decided a stand, were agreed that the establishment of
      a church institution was an objectionable and impertinent as well as
      unnecessary proceeding.
    </p>
    <p>
      Of course, Hi Kendal and his friend Bronco Bill had no opinion one way or
      the other. The Church could hardly affect them even remotely. A dozen
      years' stay in Montana had proved with sufficient clearness to them that a
      church was a luxury of civilization the West might well do without.
    </p>
    <p>
      Outside the Company of the Noble Seven there was only one whose opinion
      had value in Swan Creek, and that was the Old Timer. The Company had
      sought to bring him in by making him an honorary member, but he refused to
      be drawn from his home far up among the hills, where he lived with his
      little girl Gwen and her old half-breed nurse, Ponka. The approach of the
      church he seemed to resent as a personal injury. It represented to him
      that civilization from which he had fled fifteen years ago with his wife
      and baby girl, and when five years later he laid his wife in the lonely
      grave that could be seen on the shaded knoll just fronting his cabin door,
      the last link to his past was broken. From all that suggested the great
      world beyond the run of the Prairie he shrank as one shrinks from a sudden
      touch upon an old wound.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I guess I'll have to move back,&rdquo; he said to me gloomily.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why?&rdquo; I said in surprise, thinking of his grazing range, which was ample
      for his herd.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This blank Sky Pilot.&rdquo; He never swore except when unusually moved.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sky Pilot?&rdquo; I inquired.
    </p>
    <p>
      He nodded and silently pointed to the notice.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, well, he won't hurt you, will he?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Can't stand it,&rdquo; he answered savagely, &ldquo;must get away.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What about Gwen?&rdquo; I ventured, for she was the light of his eyes. &ldquo;Pity to
      stop her studies.&rdquo; I was giving her weekly lessons at the old man's ranch.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dunno. Ain't figgered out yet about that baby.&rdquo; She was still his baby.
      &ldquo;Guess she's all she wants for the Foothills, anyway. What's the use?&rdquo; he
      added, bitterly, talking to himself after the manner of men who live much
      alone.
    </p>
    <p>
      I waited for a moment, then said: &ldquo;Well, I wouldn't hurry about doing
      anything,&rdquo; knowing well that the one thing an old-timer hates to do is to
      make any change in his mode of life. &ldquo;Maybe he won't stay.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He caught at this eagerly. &ldquo;That's so! There ain't much to keep him,
      anyway,&rdquo; and he rode off to his lonely ranch far up in the hills.
    </p>
    <p>
      I looked after the swaying figure and tried to picture his past with its
      tragedy; then I found myself wondering how he would end and what would
      come to his little girl. And I made up my mind that if the missionary were
      the right sort his coming might not be a bad thing for the Old Timer and
      perhaps for more than him.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER IV
    </h2>
    <h3>
      THE PILOT'S MEASURE
    </h3>
    <p>
      It was Hi Kendal that announced the arrival of the missionary. I was
      standing at the door of my school, watching the children ride off home on
      their ponies, when Hi came loping along on his bronco in the loose-jointed
      cowboy style.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; he drawled out, bringing his bronco to a dead stop in a single
      bound, &ldquo;he's lit.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Lit? Where? What?&rdquo; said I, looking round for an eagle or some other
      flying thing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your blanked Sky Pilot, and he's a beauty, a pretty kid&mdash;looks too
      tender for this climate. Better not let him out on the range.&rdquo; Hi was
      quite disgusted, evidently.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What's the matter with him, Hi?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, HE ain't no parson! I don't go much on parsons, but when I calls for
      one I don't want no bantam chicken. No, sirree, horse! I don't want no
      blankety-blank, pink-and-white complected nursery kid foolin' round my
      graveyard. If you're goin' to bring along a parson, why bring him with his
      eye-teeth cut and his tail feathers on.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      That Hi was deeply disappointed was quite clear from the selection of the
      profanity with which he adorned this lengthy address. It was never the
      extent of his profanity, but the choice, that indicated Hi's interest in
      any subject.
    </p>
    <p>
      Altogether, the outlook for the missionary was not encouraging. With the
      single exception of the Muirs, who really counted for little, nobody
      wanted him. To most of the reckless young bloods of the Company of the
      Noble Seven his presence was an offence; to others simply a nuisance,
      while the Old Timer regarded his advent with something like dismay; and
      now Hi's impression of his personal appearance was not cheering.
    </p>
    <p>
      My first sight of him did not reassure me. He was very slight, very young,
      very innocent, with a face that might do for an angel, except for the
      touch of humor in it, but which seemed strangely out of place among the
      rough, hard faces that were to be seen in the Swan Creek Country. It was
      not a weak face, however. The forehead was high and square, the mouth
      firm, and the eyes were luminous, of some dark color&mdash;violet, if
      there is such a color in eyes&mdash;dreamy or sparkling, according to his
      mood; eyes for which a woman might find use, but which, in a missionary's
      head, appeared to me one of those extraordinary wastes of which Nature is
      sometimes guilty.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was gazing far away into space infinitely beyond the Foothills and the
      blue line of the mountains behind them. He turned to me as I drew near,
      with eyes alight and face glowing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is glorious,&rdquo; he almost panted. &ldquo;You see this everyday!&rdquo; Then,
      recalling himself, he came eagerly toward me, stretching out his hand.
      &ldquo;You are the schoolmaster, I know. Do you know, it's a great thing? I
      wanted to be one, but I never could get the boys on. They always got me
      telling them tales. I was awfully disappointed. I am trying the next best
      thing. You see, I won't have to keep order, but I don't think I can preach
      very well. I am going to visit your school. Have you many scholars? Do you
      know, I think it's splendid? I wish I could do it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I had intended to be somewhat stiff with him, but his evident admiration
      of me made me quite forget this laudable intention, and, as he talked on
      without waiting for an answer, his enthusiasm, his deference to my
      opinion, his charm of manner, his beautiful face, his luminous eyes, made
      him perfectly irresistible; and before I was aware I was listening to his
      plans for working his mission with eager interest. So eager was my
      interest, indeed, that before I was aware I found myself asking him to tea
      with me in my shack. But he declined, saying:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'd like to, awfully; but do you know, I think Latour expects me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This consideration of Latour's feelings almost upset me.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You come with me,&rdquo; he added, and I went.
    </p>
    <p>
      Latour welcomed us with his grim old face wreathed in unusual smiles. The
      pilot had been talking to him, too.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I've got it, Latour!&rdquo; he cried out as he entered; &ldquo;here you are,&rdquo; and he
      broke into the beautiful French-Canadian chanson, &ldquo;A la Claire Fontaine,&rdquo;
       to the old half-breed's almost tearful delight.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you know,&rdquo; he went on, &ldquo;I heard that first down the Mattawa,&rdquo; and away
      he went into a story of an experience with French-Canadian raftsmen,
      mixing up his French and English in so charming a manner that Latour; who
      in his younger days long ago had been a shantyman himself, hardly knew
      whether he was standing on his head or on his heels.
    </p>
    <p>
      After tea I proposed a ride out to see the sunset from the nearest rising
      ground. Latour, with unexampled generosity, offered his own cayuse,
      &ldquo;Louis.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I can't ride well,&rdquo; protested The Pilot.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah! dat's good ponee, Louis,&rdquo; urged Latour. &ldquo;He's quiet lak wan leetle
      mouse; he's ride lak&mdash;what you call?&mdash;wan horse-on-de-rock.&rdquo;
       Under which persuasion the pony was accepted.
    </p>
    <p>
      That evening I saw the Swan Creek country with new eyes&mdash;through the
      luminous eyes of The Pilot. We rode up the trail by the side of the Swan
      till we came to the coulee mouth, dark and full of mystery.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come on,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;we must get to the top for the sunset.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He looked lingeringly into the deep shadows and asked: &ldquo;Anything live down
      there?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Coyotes and wolves and ghosts.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ghosts?&rdquo; he asked, delightedly. &ldquo;Do you know, I was sure there were, and
      I'm quite sure I shall see them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then we took the Porcupine trail and climbed for about two miles the
      gentle slope to the top of the first rising ground. There we stayed and
      watched the sun take his nightly plunge into the sea of mountains, now
      dimly visible. Behind us stretched the prairie, sweeping out level to the
      sky and cut by the winding coulee of the Swan. Great long shadows from the
      hills were lying upon its yellow face, and far at the distant edge the
      gray haze was deepening into purple. Before us lay the hills, softly
      curving like the shoulders of great sleeping monsters, their tops still
      bright, but the separating valleys full of shadow. And there, far beyond
      them, up against the sky, was the line of the mountains&mdash;blue,
      purple, and gold, according as the light fell upon them. The sun had taken
      his plunge, but he had left behind him his robes of saffron and gold. We
      stood long without a word or movement, filling our hearts with the silence
      and the beauty, till the gold in the west began to grow dim. High above
      all the night was stretching her star-pierced, blue canopy, and drawing
      slowly up from the east over the prairie and over the sleeping hills the
      soft folds of a purple haze. The great silence of the dying day had fallen
      upon the world and held us fast.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Listen,&rdquo; he said, in a low tone, pointing to the hills. &ldquo;Can't you hear
      them breathe?&rdquo; And, looking at their curving shoulders, I fancied I could
      see them slowly heaving as if in heavy sleep, and I was quite sure I could
      hear them breathe. I was under the spell of his voice and his eyes, and
      nature was all living to me then.
    </p>
    <p>
      We rode back to the Stopping Place in silence, except for a word of mine
      now and then which he heeded not; and, with hardly a good night, he left
      me at the door. I turned away feeling as if I had been in a strange
      country and among strange people.
    </p>
    <p>
      How would he do with the Swan Creek folk? Could he make them see the hills
      breathe? Would they feel as I felt under his voice and eyes? What a
      curious mixture he was! I was doubtful about his first Sunday, and was
      surprised to find all my indifference as to his success or failure gone.
      It was a pity about the baseball match. I would speak to some of the men
      about it to-morrow.
    </p>
    <p>
      Hi might be disappointed in his appearance, but, as I turned into my shack
      and thought over my last two hours with The Pilot and how he had &ldquo;got&rdquo; old
      Latour and myself, I began to think that Hi might be mistaken in his
      measure of The Pilot.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER V
    </h2>
    <h3>
      FIRST BLOOD
    </h3>
    <p>
      One is never so enthusiastic in the early morning, when the emotions are
      calmest and the nerves at their steadiest. But I was determined to try to
      have the baseball match postponed. There could be no difficulty. One day
      was as much of a holiday as another to these easy-going fellows. But The
      Duke, when I suggested a change in the day, simply raised his eyebrows an
      eighth of an inch and said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Can't see why the day should be changed.&rdquo; Bruce stormed and swore all
      sorts of destruction upon himself if he was going to change his style of
      life for any man. The others followed The Duke's lead.
    </p>
    <p>
      That Sunday was a day of incongruities. The Old and the New, the East and
      the West, the reverential Past and iconoclastic Present were jumbling
      themselves together in bewildering confusion. The baseball match was
      played with much vigor and profanity. The expression on The Pilot's face,
      as he stood watching for a while, was a curious mixture of interest,
      surprise, doubt and pain. He was readjusting himself. He was so made as to
      be extremely sensitive to his surroundings. He took on color quickly. The
      utter indifference to the audacious disregard of all he had hitherto
      considered sacred and essential was disconcerting. They were all so dead
      sure. How did he know they were wrong? It was his first near view of
      practical, living skepticism. Skepticism in a book did not disturb him; he
      could put down words against it. But here it was alive, cheerful,
      attractive, indeed fascinating; for these men in their western garb and
      with their western swing had captured his imagination. He was in a fierce
      struggle, and in a few minutes I saw him disappear into the coulee.
    </p>
    <p>
      Meantime the match went uproariously on to a finish, with the result that
      the champions of &ldquo;Home&rdquo; had &ldquo;to stand The Painkiller,&rdquo; their defeat being
      due chiefly to the work of Hi and Bronco Bill as pitcher and catcher.
    </p>
    <p>
      The celebration was in full swing; or as Hi put it, &ldquo;the boys were takin'
      their pizen good an' calm,&rdquo; when in walked The Pilot. His face was still
      troubled and his lips were drawn and blue, as if he were in pain. A
      silence fell on the men as he walked in through the crowd and up to the
      bar. He stood a moment hesitating, looking round upon the faces flushed
      and hot that were now turned toward him in curious defiance. He noticed
      the look, and it pulled him together. He faced about toward old Latour and
      asked in a high, clear voice:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is this the room you said we might have?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Frenchman shrugged his shoulders and said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There is not any more.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The lad paused for an instant, but only for an instant. Then, lifting a
      pile of hymn books he had near him on the counter, he said in a grave,
      sweet voice, and with the quiver of a smile about his lips:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Gentlemen, Mr. Latour has allowed me this room for a religious service.
      It will give me great pleasure if you will all join,&rdquo; and immediately he
      handed a book to Bronco Bill, who, surprised, took it as if he did not
      know what to do with it. The others followed Bronco's lead till he came to
      Bruce, who refused, saying roughly:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No! I don't want it; I've no use for it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The missionary flushed and drew back as if he had been struck, but
      immediately, as if unconsciously, The Duke, who was standing near,
      stretched out his hand and said, with a courteous bow, &ldquo;I thank you; I
      should be glad of one.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thank you,&rdquo; replied The Pilot, simply, as he handed him a book. The men
      seated themselves upon the bench that ran round the room, or leaned up
      against the counter, and most of them took off their hats. Just then in
      came Muir, and behind him his little wife.
    </p>
    <p>
      In an instant The Duke was on his feet, and every hat came off.
    </p>
    <p>
      The missionary stood up at the bar, and announced the hymn, &ldquo;Jesus, Lover
      of My Soul.&rdquo; The silence that followed was broken by the sound of a horse
      galloping. A buckskin bronco shot past the window, and in a few moments
      there appeared at the door the Old Timer. He was about to stride in when
      the unusual sight of a row of men sitting solemnly with hymn books in
      their hands held him fast at the door. He gazed in an amazed, helpless way
      upon the men, then at the missionary, then back at the men, and stood
      speechless. Suddenly there was a high, shrill, boyish laugh, and the men
      turned to see the missionary in a fit of laughter. It certainly was a
      shock to any lingering ideas of religious propriety they might have about
      them; but the contrast between his frank, laughing face and the amazed and
      disgusted face of the shaggy old man in the doorway was too much for them,
      and one by one they gave way to roars of laughter. The Old Timer, however,
      kept his face unmoved, strode up to the bar and nodded to old Latour, who
      served him his drink, which he took at a gulp.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Here, old man!&rdquo; called out Bill, &ldquo;get into the game; here's your deck,&rdquo;
       offering him his book. But the missionary was before him, and, with very
      beautiful grace, he handed the Old Timer a book and pointed him to a seat.
    </p>
    <p>
      I shall never forget that service. As a religious affair it was a dead
      failure, but somehow I think The Pilot, as Hi approvingly said, &ldquo;got in
      his funny work,&rdquo; and it was not wholly a defeat. The first hymn was sung
      chiefly by the missionary and Mrs. Muir, whose voice was very high, with
      one or two of the men softly whistling an accompaniment. The second hymn
      was better, and then came the Lesson, the story of the feeding of the five
      thousand. As the missionary finished the story, Bill, who had been
      listening with great interest, said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I say, pard, I think I'll call you just now.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I beg your pardon!&rdquo; said the startled missionary.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You're givin' us quite a song and dance now, ain't you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't understand,&rdquo; was the puzzled reply.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How many men was there in the crowd?&rdquo; asked Bill, with a judicial air.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Five thousand.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And how much grub?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Five loaves and two fishes,&rdquo; answered Bruce for the missionary.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; drawled Bill, with the air of a man who has reached a conclusion,
      &ldquo;that's a little too unusual for me. Why,&rdquo; looking pityingly at the
      missionary, &ldquo;it ain't natarel.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Right you are, my boy,&rdquo; said Bruce, with a laugh. &ldquo;It's deucedly
      unnatural.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not for Him,&rdquo; said the missionary, quietly. Then Bruce joyfully took him
      up and led him on into a discussion of evidences, and from evidences into
      metaphysics, the origin of evil and the freedom of the will, till the
      missionary, as Bill said, &ldquo;was rattled worse nor a rooster in the dark.&rdquo;
       Poor little Mrs. Muir was much scandalized and looked anxiously at her
      husband, wishing him to take her out. But help came from an unexpected
      quarter, and Hi suddenly called out:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Here you, Bill, shut your blanked jaw, and you, Bruce, give the man a
      chance to work off his music.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That's so! Fair play! Go on!&rdquo; were the cries that came in response to
      Hi's appeal.
    </p>
    <p>
      The missionary, who was all trembling and much troubled, gave Hi a
      grateful look, and said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'm afraid there are a great many things I don't understand, and I am not
      good at argument.&rdquo; There were shouts of &ldquo;Go on! fire ahead, play the
      game!&rdquo; but he said, &ldquo;I think we will close the service with a hymn.&rdquo; His
      frankness and modesty, and his respectful, courteous manner gained the
      sympathy of the men, so that all joined heartily in singing, &ldquo;Sun of My
      Soul.&rdquo; In the prayer that followed his voice grew steady and his nerve
      came back to him. The words were very simple, and the petitions were
      mostly for light and for strength. With a few words of remembrance of
      &ldquo;those in our homes far away who think of us and pray for us and never
      forget,&rdquo; this strange service was brought to a close.
    </p>
    <p>
      After the missionary had stepped out, the whole affair was discussed with
      great warmth. Hi Kendal thought &ldquo;The Pilot didn't have no fair show,&rdquo;
       maintaining that when he was &ldquo;ropin' a steer he didn't want no blanked
      tenderfoot to be shovin' in his rope like Bill there.&rdquo; But Bill steadily
      maintained his position that &ldquo;the story of that there picnic was a little
      too unusual&rdquo; for him. Bruce was trying meanwhile to beguile The Duke into
      a discussion of the physics and metaphysics of the case. But The Duke
      refused with quiet contempt to be drawn into a region where he felt
      himself a stranger. He preferred poker himself, if Bruce cared to take a
      hand; and so the evening went on, with the theological discussion by Hi
      and Bill in a judicial, friendly spirit in one corner, while the others
      for the most part played poker.
    </p>
    <p>
      When the missionary returned late there were only a few left in the room,
      among them The Duke and Bruce, who was drinking steadily and losing money.
      The missionary's presence seemed to irritate him, and he played even more
      recklessly than usual, swearing deeply at every loss. At the door the
      missionary stood looking up into the night sky and humming softly &ldquo;Sun of
      My Soul,&rdquo; and after a few minutes The Duke joined in humming a bass to the
      air till Bruce could contain himself no longer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I say,&rdquo; he called out, &ldquo;this isn't any blanked prayer-meeting, is it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Duke ceased humming, and, looking at Bruce, said quietly: &ldquo;Well, what
      is it? What's the trouble?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Trouble!&rdquo; shouted Bruce. &ldquo;I don't see what hymn-singing has to do with a
      poker game.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I see! I beg pardon! Was I singing?&rdquo; said The Duke. Then after a
      pause he added, &ldquo;You're quite right. I say, Bruce, let's quit. Something
      has got on to your nerves.&rdquo; And coolly sweeping his pile into his pocket,
      he gave up the game. With an oath Bruce left the table, took another
      drink, and went unsteadily out to his horse, and soon we heard him ride
      away into the darkness, singing snatches of the hymn and swearing the most
      awful oaths.
    </p>
    <p>
      The missionary's face was white with horror. It was all new and horrible
      to him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Will he get safely home?&rdquo; he asked of The Duke.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don't you worry, youngster,&rdquo; said The Duke, in his loftiest manner,
      &ldquo;he'll get along.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The luminous, dreamy eyes grew hard and bright as they looked The Duke in
      the face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I shall worry; but you ought to worry more.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; said The Duke, raising his brows and smiling gently upon the bright,
      stern young face lifted up to his. &ldquo;I didn't notice that I had asked your
      opinion.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If anything should happen to him,&rdquo; replied the missionary, quickly, &ldquo;I
      should consider you largely responsible.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That would be kind,&rdquo; said The Duke, still smiling with his lips. But
      after a moment's steady look into the missionary's eyes he nodded his head
      twice or thrice, and, without further word, turned away.
    </p>
    <p>
      The missionary turned eagerly to me:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They beat me this afternoon,&rdquo; he cried, &ldquo;but thank God, I know now they
      are wrong and I am right! I don't understand! I can't see my way through!
      But I am right! It's true! I feel it's true! Men can't live without Him,
      and be men!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And long after I went to my shack that night I saw before me the eager
      face with the luminous eyes and heard the triumphant cry: &ldquo;I feel it's
      true! Men can't live without Him, and be men!&rdquo; and I knew that though his
      first Sunday ended in defeat there was victory yet awaiting him.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER VI
    </h2>
    <h3>
      HIS SECOND WIND
    </h3>
    <p>
      The first weeks were not pleasant for The Pilot. He had been beaten, and
      the sense of failure damped his fine enthusiasm, which was one of his
      chief charms. The Noble Seven despised, ignored, or laughed at him,
      according to their mood and disposition. Bruce patronized him; and, worst
      of all, the Muirs pitied him. This last it was that brought him low, and I
      was glad of it. I find it hard to put up with a man that enjoys pity.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was Hi Kendal that restored him, though Hi had no thought of doing so
      good a deed. It was in this way: A baseball match was on with The
      Porcupines from near the Fort. To Hi's disgust and the team's dismay Bill
      failed to appear. It was Hi's delight to stand up for Bill's pitching, and
      their battery was the glory of the Home team.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Try The Pilot, Hi,&rdquo; said some one, chaffing him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Hi looked glumly across at The Pilot standing some distance, away; then
      called out, holding up the ball:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Can you play the game?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      For answer Moore held up his hands for a catch. Hi tossed him the ball
      easily. The ball came back so quickly that Hi was hardly ready, and the
      jar seemed to amaze him exceedingly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'll take him,&rdquo; he said, doubtfully, and the game began. Hi fitted on his
      mask, a new importation and his peculiar pride, and waited.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How do you like them?&rdquo; asked The Pilot.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hot!&rdquo; said Hi. &ldquo;I hain't got no gloves to burn.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Pilot turned his back, swung off one foot on to the other and
      discharged his ball.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Strike!&rdquo; called the umpire.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You bet!&rdquo; said Hi, with emphasis, but his face was a picture of amazement
      and dawning delight.
    </p>
    <p>
      Again The Pilot went through the manoeuvre in his box and again the umpire
      called:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Strike!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Hi stopped the ball without holding it and set himself for the third. Once
      more that disconcerting swing and the whip-like action of the arm, and for
      the third time the umpire called:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Strike! Striker out!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That's the hole,&rdquo; yelled Hi.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Porcupines were amazed. Hi looked at the ball in his hand, then at the
      slight figure of The Pilot.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I say! where do you get it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What?&rdquo; asked Moore innocently.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The gait!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The what?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The gait! the speed, you know!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! I used to play in Princeton a little.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did, eh? What the blank blank did you quit for?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He evidently regarded the exchange of the profession of baseball for the
      study of theology as a serious error in judgment, and in this opinion
      every inning of the game confirmed him. At the bat The Pilot did not
      shine, but he made up for light hitting by his base-running. He was fleet
      as a deer, and he knew the game thoroughly. He was keen, eager, intense in
      play, and before the innings were half over he was recognized as the best
      all-round man on the field. In the pitcher's box he puzzled the Porcupines
      till they grew desperate and hit wildly and blindly, amid the jeers of the
      spectators. The bewilderment of the Porcupines was equaled only by the
      enthusiasm of Hi and his nine, and when the game was over the score stood
      37 to 7 in favor of the Home team. They carried The Pilot off the field.
    </p>
    <p>
      From that day Moore was another man. He had won the unqualified respect of
      Hi Kendal and most of the others, for he could beat them at their own game
      and still be modest about it. Once more his enthusiasm came back and his
      brightness and his courage. The Duke was not present to witness his
      triumph, and, besides, he rather despised the game. Bruce was there,
      however, but took no part in the general acclaim; indeed, he seemed rather
      disgusted with Moore's sudden leap into favor. Certainly his hostility to
      The Pilot and to all that he stood for was none the less open and bitter.
    </p>
    <p>
      The hostility was more than usually marked at the service held on the
      Sunday following. It was, perhaps, thrown into stronger relief by the open
      and delighted approval of Hi, who was prepared to back up anything The
      Pilot would venture to say. Bill, who had not witnessed The Pilot's
      performance in the pitcher's box, but had only Hi's enthusiastic report to
      go upon, still preserved his judicial air. It is fair to say, however,
      that there was no mean-spirited jealousy in Bill's heart even though Hi
      had frankly assured him that The Pilot was &ldquo;a demon,&rdquo; and could &ldquo;give him
      points.&rdquo; Bill had great confidence in Hi's opinion upon baseball, but he
      was not prepared to surrender his right of private judgment in matters
      theological, so he waited for the sermon before committing himself to any
      enthusiastic approval. This service was an undoubted success. The singing
      was hearty, and insensibly the men fell into a reverent attitude during
      prayer. The theme, too, was one that gave little room for skepticism. It
      was the story of Zaccheus, and story-telling was Moore's strong point. The
      thing was well done. Vivid portraitures of the outcast, shrewd, converted
      publican and the supercilious, self-complacent, critical Pharisee were
      drawn with a few deft touches. A single sentence transferred them to the
      Foothills and arrayed them in cowboy garb. Bill was none too sure of
      himself, but Hi, with delightful winks, was indicating Bruce as the
      Pharisee, to the latter's scornful disgust. The preacher must have
      noticed, for with a very clever turn the Pharisee was shown to be the kind
      of man who likes to fit faults upon others. Then Bill, digging his elbows
      into Hi's ribs, said in an audible whisper:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Say, pardner, how does it fit now?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You git out!&rdquo; answered Hi, indignantly, but his confidence in his
      interpretation of the application was shaken. When Moore came to describe
      the Master and His place in that ancient group, we in the Stopping Place
      parlor fell under the spell of his eyes and voice, and our hearts were
      moved within us. That great Personality was made very real and very
      winning. Hi was quite subdued by the story and the picture. Bill was
      perplexed; it was all new to him; but Bruce was mainly irritated. To him
      it was all old and filled with memories he hated to face. At any rate he
      was unusually savage that evening, drank heavily and went home late,
      raging and cursing at things in general and The Pilot in particular&mdash;for
      Moore, in a timid sort of way, had tried to quiet him and help him to his
      horse.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ornery sort o' beast now, ain't he?&rdquo; said Hi, with the idea of comforting
      The Pilot, who stood sadly looking after Bruce disappearing in the gloom.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No! no!&rdquo; he answered, quickly, &ldquo;not a beast, but a brother.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Brother! Not much, if I know my relations!&rdquo; answered Hi, disgustedly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The Master thinks a good deal of him,&rdquo; was the earnest reply.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Git out!&rdquo; said Hi, &ldquo;you don't mean it! Why,&rdquo; he added, decidedly, &ldquo;he's
      more stuck on himself than that mean old cuss you was tellin' about this
      afternoon, and without half the reason.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But Moore only said, kindly, &ldquo;Don't be hard on him, Hi,&rdquo; and turned away,
      leaving Hi and Bill gravely discussing the question, with the aid of
      several drinks of whisky. They were still discussing when, an hour later,
      they, too, disappeared into the darkness that swallowed up the trail to
      Ashley Ranch. That was the first of many such services. The preaching was
      always of the simplest kind, abstract questions being avoided and the
      concrete in those wonderful Bible tales, dressed in modern and in western
      garb, set forth. Bill and Hi were more than ever his friends and
      champions, and the latter was heard exultantly to exclaim to Bruce:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He ain't much to look at as a parson, but he's a-ketchin' his second
      wind, and 'fore long you won't see him for dust.&rdquo;

    <h2>
      CHAPTER VII
    </h2>
    <h3>
      THE LAST OF THE PERMIT SUNDAYS
    </h3>
    <p>
      The spring &ldquo;round-ups&rdquo; were all over and Bruce had nothing to do but to
      loaf about the Stopping Place, drinking old Latour's bad whisky and making
      himself a nuisance. In vain The Pilot tried to win him with loans of books
      and magazines and other kindly courtesies. He would be decent for a day
      and then would break forth in violent argumentation against religion and
      all who held to it. He sorely missed The Duke, who was away south on one
      of his periodic journeys, of which no one knew anything or cared to ask.
      The Duke's presence always steadied Bruce and took the rasp out of his
      manners. It was rather a relief to all that he was absent from the next
      fortnightly service, though Moore declared he was ashamed to confess this
      relief.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I can't touch him,&rdquo; he said to me, after the service; &ldquo;he is far too
      clever, but,&rdquo; and his voice was full of pain, &ldquo;I'd give something to help
      him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If he doesn't quit his nonsense,&rdquo; I replied, &ldquo;he'll soon be past helping.
      He doesn't go out on his range, his few cattle wander everywhere, his
      shack is in a beastly state, and he himself is going to pieces, miserable
      fool that he is.&rdquo; For it did seem a shame that a fellow should so throw
      himself away for nothing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are hard,&rdquo; said Moore, with his eyes upon me.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hard? Isn't it true?&rdquo; I answered, hotly. &ldquo;Then, there's his mother at
      home.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, but can he help it? Is it all his fault?&rdquo; he replied, with his
      steady eyes still looking into me.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;His fault? Whose fault, then?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What of the Noble Seven? Have they anything to do with this?&rdquo; His voice
      was quiet, but there was an arresting intensity in it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; I said, rather weakly, &ldquo;a man ought to look after himself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes!&mdash;and his brother a little.&rdquo; Then, he added: &ldquo;What have any of
      you done to help him? The Duke could have pulled him up a year ago if he
      had been willing to deny himself a little, and so with all of you. You all
      do just what pleases you regardless of any other, and so you help one
      another down.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I could not find anything just then to say, though afterwards many things
      came to me; for, though his voice was quiet and low, his eyes were glowing
      and his face was alight with the fire that burned within, and I felt like
      one convicted of a crime. This was certainly a new doctrine for the West;
      an uncomfortable doctrine to practice, interfering seriously with personal
      liberty, but in The Pilot's way of viewing things difficult to escape.
      There would be no end to one's responsibility. I refused to think it out.
    </p>
    <p>
      Within a fortnight we were thinking it out with some intentness. The Noble
      Seven were to have a great &ldquo;blow-out&rdquo; at the Hill brothers' ranch. The
      Duke had got home from his southern trip a little more weary-looking and a
      little more cynical in his smile. The &ldquo;blow-out&rdquo; was to be held on Permit
      Sunday, the alternate to the Preaching Sunday, which was a concession to
      The Pilot, secured chiefly through the influence of Hi and his baseball
      nine. It was something to have created the situation involved in the
      distinction between Preaching and Permit Sundays. Hi put it rather
      graphically. &ldquo;The devil takes his innin's one Sunday and The Pilot the
      next,&rdquo; adding emphatically, &ldquo;He hain't done much scorin' yit, but my
      money's on The Pilot, you bet!&rdquo; Bill was more cautious and preferred to
      wait developments. And developments were rapid.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Hill brothers' meet was unusually successful from a social point of
      view. Several Permits had been requisitioned, and whisky and beer
      abounded. Races all day and poker all night and drinks of various brews
      both day and night, with varying impromptu diversions&mdash;such as
      shooting the horns off wandering steers&mdash;were the social amenities
      indulged in by the noble company. On Monday evening I rode out to the
      ranch, urged by Moore, who was anxious that someone should look after
      Bruce.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't belong to them,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;you do. They won't resent your
      coming.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Nor did they. They were sitting at tea, and welcomed me with a shout.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hello, old domine!&rdquo; yelled Bruce, &ldquo;where's your preacher friend?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where you ought to be, if you could get there&mdash;at home,&rdquo; I replied,
      nettled at his insolent tone.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Strike one!&rdquo; called out Hi, enthusiastically, not approving Bruce's
      attitude toward his friend, The Pilot.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don't be so acute,&rdquo; said Bruce, after the laugh had passed, &ldquo;but have a
      drink.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He was flushed and very shaky and very noisy. The Duke, at the head of the
      table, looked a little harder than usual, but, though pale, was quite
      steady. The others were all more or less nerve-broken, and about the room
      were the signs of a wild night. A bench was upset, while broken bottles
      and crockery lay strewn about over a floor reeking with filth. The disgust
      on my face called forth an apology from the younger Hill, who was serving
      up ham and eggs as best he could to the men lounging about the table.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's my housemaid's afternoon out,&rdquo; he explained gravely.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Gone for a walk in the park,&rdquo; added an other.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hope MISTER Connor will pardon the absence,&rdquo; sneered Bruce, in his most
      offensive manner.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don't mind him,&rdquo; said Hi, under his breath, &ldquo;the blue devils are runnin'
      him down.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This became more evident as the evening went on. From hilarity Bruce
      passed to sullen ferocity, with spasms of nervous terror. Hi's attempts to
      soothe him finally drove him mad, and he drew his revolver, declaring he
      could look after himself, in proof of which he began to shoot out the
      lights.
    </p>
    <p>
      The men scrambled into safe corners, all but The Duke, who stood quietly
      by watching Bruce shoot. Then saying:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let me have a try, Bruce,&rdquo; he reached across and caught his hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No! you don't,&rdquo; said Bruce, struggling. &ldquo;No man gets my gun.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He tore madly at the gripping hand with both of his, but in vain, calling
      out with frightful oaths:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let go! let go! I'll kill you! I'll kill you!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      With a furious effort he hurled himself back from the table, dragging The
      Duke partly across. There was a flash and a report and Bruce collapsed,
      The Duke still gripping him. When they lifted him up he was found to have
      an ugly wound in his arm, the bullet having passed through the fleshy
      part. I bound it up as best I could and tried to persuade him to go to
      bed. But he would go home. Nothing could stop him. Finally The Duke agreed
      to go with him, and off they set, Bruce loudly protesting that he could
      get home alone and did not want anyone.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was a dismal break-up to the meet, and we all went home feeling rather
      sick, so that it gave me no pleasure to find Moore waiting in my shack for
      my report of Bruce. It was quite vain for me to make light of the accident
      to him. His eyes were wide open with anxious fear when I had done.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You needn't tell me not to be anxious,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;you are anxious
      yourself. I see it, I feel it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, there's no use trying to keep things from you,&rdquo; I replied, &ldquo;but I
      am only a little anxious. Don't you go beyond me and work yourself up into
      a fever over it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; he answered quietly, &ldquo;but I wish his mother were nearer.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, bosh, it isn't coming to that; but I wish he were in better shape. He
      is broken up badly without this hole in him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He would not leave till I had promised to take him up the next day, though
      I was doubtful enough of his reception. But next day The Duke came down,
      his black bronco, Jingo, wet with hard riding.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Better come up, Connor,&rdquo; he said, gravely, &ldquo;and bring your bromides
      along. He has had a bad night and morning and fell asleep only before I
      came away. I expect he'll wake in delirium. It's the whisky more than the
      bullet. Snakes, you know.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      In ten minutes we three were on the trail, for Moore, though not invited,
      quietly announced his intention to go with us.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, all right,&rdquo; said The Duke, indifferently, &ldquo;he probably won't
      recognize you any way.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      We rode hard for half an hour till we came within sight of Bruce's shack,
      which was set back into a little poplar bluff.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hold up!&rdquo; said The Duke. &ldquo;Was that a shot?&rdquo; We stood listening. A
      rifle-shot rang out, and we rode hard. Again The Duke halted us, and there
      came from the shack the sound of singing. It was an old Scotch tune.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The twenty-third Psalm,&rdquo; said Moore, in a low voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      We rode into the bluff, tied up our horses and crept to the back of the
      shack. Looking through a crack between the logs, I saw a gruesome thing.
      Bruce was sitting up in bed with a Winchester rifle across his knees and a
      belt of cartridges hanging over the post. His bandages were torn off, the
      blood from his wound was smeared over his bare arms and his pale, ghastly
      face; his eyes were wild with mad terror, and he was shouting at the top
      of his voice the words:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     &ldquo;The Lord's my shepherd, I'll not want,
        He makes me down to lie
      In pastures green, He leadeth me
        The quiet waters by.&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      Now and then he would stop to say in an awesome whisper, &ldquo;Come out here,
      you little devils!&rdquo; and bang would go his rifle at the stovepipe, which
      was riddled with holes. Then once more in a loud voice he would hurry to
      begin the Psalm,
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     &ldquo;The Lord's my Shepherd.&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      Nothing that my memory brings to me makes me chill like that picture&mdash;the
      low log shack, now in cheerless disorder; the ghastly object upon the bed
      in the corner, with blood-smeared face and arms and mad terror in the
      eyes; the awful cursings and more awful psalm-singing, punctuated by the
      quick report of the deadly rifle.
    </p>
    <p>
      For some moments we stood gazing at one another; then The Duke said, in a
      low, fierce tone, more to himself than to us:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This is the last. There'll be no more of this cursed folly among the
      boys.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And I thought it a wise thing in The Pilot that he answered not a word.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER VIII
    </h2>
    <h3>
      THE PILOT'S GRIP
    </h3>
    <p>
      The situation was one of extreme danger&mdash;a madman with a Winchester
      rifle. Something must be done and quickly. But what? It would be death to
      anyone appearing at the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'll speak; you keep your eyes on him,&rdquo; said The Duke.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hello, Bruce! What's the row?&rdquo; shouted The Duke.
    </p>
    <p>
      Instantly the singing stopped. A look of cunning delight came over his
      face as, without a word, he got his rifle ready pointed at the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come in!&rdquo; he yelled, after waiting for some moments. &ldquo;Come in! You're the
      biggest of all the devils. Come on, I'll send you down where you belong.
      Come, what's keeping you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Over the rifle-barrel his eyes gleamed with frenzied delight. We consulted
      as to a plan.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't relish a bullet much,&rdquo; I said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There are pleasanter things,&rdquo; responded The Duke, &ldquo;and he is a fairly
      good shot.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Meantime the singing had started again, and, looking through the chink, I
      saw that Bruce had got his eye on the stovepipe again. While I was looking
      The Pilot slipped away from us toward the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come back!&rdquo; said the Duke, &ldquo;don't be a fool! Come back, he'll shoot you
      dead!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Moore paid no heed to him, but stood waiting at the door. In a few moments
      Bruce blazed away again at the stovepipe. Immediately the Pilot burst in,
      calling out eagerly:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did you get him?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No!&rdquo; said Bruce, disappointedly, &ldquo;he dodged like the devil, as of course
      he ought, you know.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'll get him,&rdquo; said Moore. &ldquo;Smoke him out,&rdquo; proceeding to open the stove
      door.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Stop!&rdquo; screamed Bruce, &ldquo;don't open that door! It's full, I tell you.&rdquo;
       Moore paused. &ldquo;Besides,&rdquo; went on Bruce, &ldquo;smoke won't touch 'em.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, that's all right,&rdquo; said Moore, coolly and with admirable quickness,
      &ldquo;wood smoke, you know&mdash;they can't stand that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This was apparently a new idea in demonology for Bruce, for he sank back,
      while Moore lighted the fire and put on the tea-kettle. He looked round
      for the tea-caddy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Up there,&rdquo; said Bruce, forgetting for the moment his devils, and pointing
      to a quaint, old-fashioned tea-caddy upon the shelf.
    </p>
    <p>
      Moore took it down, turned it in his hands and looked at Bruce.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Old country, eh?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My mother's,&rdquo; said Bruce, soberly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I could have sworn it was my aunt's in Balleymena,&rdquo; said Moore. &ldquo;My aunt
      lived in a little stone cottage with roses all over the front of it.&rdquo; And
      on he went into an enthusiastic description of his early home. His voice
      was full of music, soft and soothing, and poor Bruce sank back and
      listened, the glitter fading from his eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Duke and I looked at each other.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not too bad, eh?&rdquo; said The Duke, after a few moments' silence.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let's put up the horses,&rdquo; I suggested. &ldquo;They won't want us for half an
      hour.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      When we came in, the room had been set in order, the tea-kettle was
      singing, the bedclothes straightened out, and Moore had just finished
      washing the blood stains from Bruce's arms and neck.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Just in time,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I didn't like to tackle these,&rdquo; pointing to the
      bandages.
    </p>
    <p>
      All night long Moore soothed and tended the sick man, now singing softly
      to him, and again beguiling him with tales that meant nothing, but that
      had a strange power to quiet the nervous restlessness, due partly to the
      pain of the wounded arm and partly to the nerve-wrecking from his months
      of dissipation. The Duke seemed uncomfortable enough. He spoke to Bruce
      once or twice, but the only answer was a groan or curse with an increase
      of restlessness.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He'll have a close squeak,&rdquo; said The Duke. The carelessness of the tone
      was a little overdone, but The Pilot was stirred up by it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He has not been fortunate in his friends,&rdquo; he said, looking straight into
      his eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A man ought to know himself when the pace is too swift,&rdquo; said The Duke, a
      little more quickly than was his wont.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You might have done anything with him. Why didn't you help him?&rdquo; Moore's
      tones were stern and very steady, and he never moved his eyes from the
      other man's face, but the only reply he got was a shrug of the shoulders.
    </p>
    <p>
      When the gray of the morning was coming in at the window The Duke rose up,
      gave himself, a little shake, and said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am not of any service here. I shall come back in the evening.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He went and stood for a few moments looking down upon the hot, fevered
      face; then, turning to me, he asked:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What do you think?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Can't say! The bromide is holding him down just now. His blood is bad for
      that wound.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Can I get anything?&rdquo; I knew him well enough to recognize the anxiety
      under his indifferent manner.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The Fort doctor ought to be got.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He nodded and went out.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have breakfast?&rdquo; called out Moore from the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I shall get some at the Fort, thanks. They won't take any hurt from me
      there,&rdquo; he said, smiling his cynical smile.
    </p>
    <p>
      Moore opened his eyes in surprise.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What's that for?&rdquo; he asked me.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, he is rather cut up, and you rather rubbed it into him, you know,&rdquo;
       I said, for I thought Moore a little hard.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did I say anything untrue?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, not untrue, perhaps; but truth is like medicine&mdash;not always
      good to take.&rdquo; At which Moore was silent till his patient needed him
      again.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was a weary day. The intense pain from the wound, and the high fever
      from the poison in his blood kept the poor fellow in delirium till
      evening, when The Duke rode up with the Fort doctor. Jingo appeared as
      nearly played out as a horse of his spirit ever allowed himself to become.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Seventy miles,&rdquo; said The Duke, swinging himself off the saddle. &ldquo;The
      doctor was ten miles out. How is he?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I shook my head, and he led away his horse to give him a rub and a feed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Meantime the doctor, who was of the army and had seen service, was
      examining his patient. He grew more and more puzzled as he noted the
      various symptoms. Finally he broke out:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What have you been doing to him? Why is he in this condition? This
      fleabite doesn't account for all,&rdquo; pointing to the wound.
    </p>
    <p>
      We stood like children reproved. Then The Duke said, hesitatingly:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I fear, doctor, the life has been a little too hard for him. He had a
      severe nervous attack&mdash;seeing things, you know.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I know,&rdquo; stormed the old doctor. &ldquo;I know you well enough, with your
      head of cast-iron and no nerves to speak of. I know the crowd and how you
      lead them. Infernal fools! You'll get your turn some day. I've warned you
      before.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Duke was standing up before the doctor during this storm, smiling
      slightly. All at once the smile faded out and he pointed to the bed. Bruce
      was sitting up quiet and steady. He stretched out his hand to The Duke.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don't mind the old fool,&rdquo; he said, holding The Duke's hand and looking up
      at him as fondly as if he were a girl. &ldquo;It's my own funeral&mdash;funeral?&rdquo;
       he paused&mdash;&ldquo;Perhaps it may be&mdash;who knows?&mdash;feel queer
      enough&mdash;but remember, Duke&mdash;it's my own fault&mdash;don't listen
      to those bally fools,&rdquo; looking towards Moore and the doctor. &ldquo;My own
      fault&rdquo;&mdash;his voice died down&mdash;&ldquo;my own fault.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Duke bent over him and laid him back on the pillow, saying, &ldquo;Thanks,
      old chap, you're good stuff. I'll not forget. Just keep quiet and you'll
      be all right.&rdquo; He passed his cool, firm hand over the hot brow of the man
      looking up at him with love in his eyes, and in a few moments Bruce fell
      asleep. Then The Duke lifted himself up, and facing the doctor, said in
      his coolest tone:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your words are more true than opportune, doctor. Your patient will need
      all your attention. As for my morals, Mr. Moore kindly entrusts himself
      with the care of them.&rdquo; This with a bow toward The Pilot.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wish him joy of his charge,&rdquo; snorted the doctor, turning again to the
      bed, where Bruce had already passed into delirium.
    </p>
    <p>
      The memory of that vigil was like a horrible nightmare for months. Moore
      lay on the floor and slept. The Duke rode off somewhither. The old doctor
      and I kept watch. All night poor Bruce raved in the wildest delirium,
      singing, now psalms, now songs, swearing at the cattle or his poker
      partners, and now and then, in quieter moments, he was back in his old
      home, a boy, with a boy's friends and sports. Nothing could check the
      fever. It baffled the doctor, who often, during the night, declared that
      there was &ldquo;no sense in a wound like that working up such a fever,&rdquo; adding
      curses upon the folly of The Duke and his Company.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You don't think he will not get better, doctor?&rdquo; I asked, in answer to
      one of his outbreaks.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He ought to get over this,&rdquo; he answered, impatiently, &ldquo;but I believe,&rdquo; he
      added, deliberately, &ldquo;he'll have to go.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Everything stood still for a moment. It seemed impossible. Two days ago
      full of life, now on the way out. There crowded in upon me thoughts of his
      home; his mother, whose letters he used to show me full of anxious love;
      his wild life here, with all its generous impulses, its mistakes, its
      folly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How long will he last?&rdquo; I asked, and my lips were dry and numb.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perhaps twenty-four hours, perhaps longer. He can't throw off the
      poison.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The old doctor proved a true prophet. After another day of agonized
      delirium he sank into a stupor which lasted through the night.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then the change came. As the light began to grow at the eastern rim of the
      prairie and up the far mountains in the west, Bruce opened his eyes and
      looked about upon us. The doctor had gone; The Duke had not come back;
      Moore and I were alone. He gazed at us steadily for some moments; read our
      faces; a look of wonder came into his eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is it coming?&rdquo; he asked in a faint, awed voice. &ldquo;Do you really think I
      must go?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The eager appeal in his voice and the wistful longing in the wide-open,
      startled eyes were too much for Moore. He backed behind me and I could
      hear him weeping like a baby. Bruce heard him, too.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is that The Pilot?&rdquo; he asked. Instantly Moore pulled himself up, wiped
      his eyes and came round to the other side of the bed and looked down,
      smiling.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do YOU say I am dying?&rdquo; The voice was strained in its earnestness. I felt
      a thrill of admiration go through me as the Pilot answered in a sweet,
      clear voice: &ldquo;They say so, Bruce. But you are not afraid?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Bruce kept his eyes on his face and answered with grave hesitation:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No&mdash;not&mdash;afraid&mdash;but I'd like to live a little longer.
      I've made such a mess of it, I'd like to try again.&rdquo; Then he paused, and
      his lips quivered a little. &ldquo;There's my mother, you know,&rdquo; he added,
      apologetically, &ldquo;and Jim.&rdquo; Jim was his younger brother and sworn chum.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I know, Bruce, but it won't be very long for them, too, and it's a
      good place.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I believe it all&mdash;always did&mdash;talked rot&mdash;you'll
      forgive me that?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don't; don't,&rdquo; said Moore quickly, with sharp pain in his voice, and
      Bruce smiled a little and closed his eyes, saying: &ldquo;I'm tired.&rdquo; But he
      immediately opened them again and looked up.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is it?&rdquo; asked Moore, smiling down into his eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The Duke,&rdquo; the poor lips whispered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He is coming,&rdquo; said Moore, confidently, though how he knew I could not
      tell. But even as he spoke, looking out of the window, I saw Jingo come
      swinging round the bluff. Bruce heard the beat of his hoofs, smiled,
      opened his eyes and waited. The leap of joy in his eyes as The Duke came
      in, clean, cool and fresh as the morning, went to my heart.
    </p>
    <p>
      Neither man said a word, but Bruce took hold of The Duke's hand in both of
      his. He was fast growing weaker. I gave him brandy, and he recovered a
      little strength.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am dying, Duke,&rdquo; he said, quietly. &ldquo;Promise you won't blame yourself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I can't, old man,&rdquo; said The Duke, with a shudder. &ldquo;Would to heaven I
      could.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You were too strong for me, and you didn't think, did you?&rdquo; and the weak
      voice had a caress in it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, no! God knows,&rdquo; said The Duke, hurriedly.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was a long silence, and again Bruce opened his eyes and whispered:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The Pilot.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Moore came to him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Read 'The Prodigal,'&rdquo; he said faintly, and in Moore's clear, sweet voice
      the music of that matchless story fell upon our ears.
    </p>
    <p>
      Again Bruce's eyes summoned me. I bent over him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My letter,&rdquo; he said, faintly, &ldquo;in my coat&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I brought to him the last letter from his mother. He held the envelope
      before his eyes, then handed it to me, whispering:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Read.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I opened the letter and looked at the words, &ldquo;My darling Davie.&rdquo; My tongue
      stuck and not a sound could I make. Moore put out his hand and took it
      from me. The Duke rose to go out, calling me with his eyes, but Bruce
      motioned him to stay, and he sat down and bowed his head, while Moore read
      the letter.
    </p>
    <p>
      His tones were clear and steady till he came to the last words, when his
      voice broke and ended in a sob:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And oh, Davie, laddie, if ever your heart turns home again, remember the
      door is aye open, and it's joy you'll bring with you to us all.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Bruce lay quite still, and, from his closed eyes, big tears ran down his
      cheeks. It was his last farewell to her whose love had been to him the
      anchor to all things pure here and to heaven beyond.
    </p>
    <p>
      He took the letter from Moore's hand, put it with difficulty to his lips,
      and then, touching the open Bible, he said, between his breaths:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's&mdash;very like&mdash;there's really&mdash;no fear, is there?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, no!&rdquo; said Moore, with cheerful, confident voice, though his, tears
      were flowing. &ldquo;No fear of your welcome.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      His eyes met mine. I bent over him. &ldquo;Tell her&mdash;&rdquo; and his voice faded
      away.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What shall I tell her?&rdquo; I asked, trying to recall him. But the message
      was never given. He moved one hand slowly toward The Duke till it touched
      his head. The Duke lifted his face and looked down at him, and then he did
      a beautiful thing for which I forgave him much. He stooped over and kissed
      the lips grown so white, and then the brow. The light came back into the
      eyes of the dying man, he smiled once more, and smilingly faced toward the
      Great Beyond. And the morning air, fresh from the sun-tipped mountains and
      sweet with the scent of the June roses, came blowing soft and cool through
      the open window upon the dead, smiling face. And it seemed fitting so. It
      came from the land of the Morning.
    </p>
    <p>
      Again The Duke did a beautiful thing; for, reaching across his dead
      friend, he offered his hand to The Pilot. &ldquo;Mr. Moore,&rdquo; he said, with fine
      courtesy, &ldquo;you are a brave man and a good man; I ask your forgiveness for
      much rudeness.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But Moore only shook his head while he took the outstretched hand, and
      said, brokenly:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don't! I can't stand it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The Company of the Noble Seven will meet no more,&rdquo; said The Duke, with a
      faint smile.
    </p>
    <p>
      They did meet, however; but when they did, The Pilot was in the chair, and
      it was not for poker.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Pilot had &ldquo;got his grip,&rdquo; as Bill said.

      CHAPTER IX
    </h2>
    <h3>
      GWEN
    </h3>
    <p>
      It was not many days after my arrival in the Foothill country that I began
      to hear of Gwen. They all had stories of her. The details were not many,
      but the impression was vivid. She lived remote from that centre of
      civilization known as Swan Creek in the postal guide, but locally as Old
      Latour's, far up among the hills near the Devil's Lake, and from her
      father's ranch she never ventured. But some of the men had had glimpses of
      her and had come to definite opinions regarding her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is she like?&rdquo; I asked Bill one day, trying to pin him down to
      something like a descriptive account of her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Like! She's a terrer,&rdquo; he said, with slow emphasis, &ldquo;a holy terrer.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But what is she like? What does she look like?&rdquo; I asked impatiently.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Look like?&rdquo; He considered a moment, looked slowly round as if searching
      for a simile, then answered: &ldquo;I dunno.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don't know? What do you mean? Haven't you seen her?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yeh! But she ain't like nothin'.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Bill was quite decided upon this point.
    </p>
    <p>
      I tried again.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, what sort of hair has she got? She's got hair, I suppose?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hayer! Well, a few!&rdquo; said Bill, with some choice combinations of
      profanity in repudiation of my suggestion. &ldquo;Yards of it! Red!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Git out!&rdquo; contradicted Hi. &ldquo;Red! Tain't no more red than mine!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Bill regarded Hi's hair critically.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What color do you put onto your old brush?&rdquo; he asked cautiously.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'Tain't no difference. 'Tain't red, anyhow.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Red! Well, not quite exactly,&rdquo; and Bill went off into a low, long,
      choking chuckle, ejaculating now and then, &ldquo;Red! Jee-mi-ny Ann! Red!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, Hi,&rdquo; he went on, recovering himself with the same abruptness as he
      used with his bronco, and looking at his friend with a face even more than
      usually solemn, &ldquo;your hayer ain't red, Hi; don't let any of your relatives
      persuade you to that. 'Tain't red!&rdquo; and he threatened to go off again, but
      pulled himself up with dangerous suddenness. &ldquo;It may be blue, cerulyum
      blue or even purple, but red&mdash;!&rdquo; He paused violently, looking at his
      friend as if he found him a new and interesting object of study upon which
      he could not trust himself to speak. Nor could he be induced to proceed
      with the description he had begun.
    </p>
    <p>
      But Hi, paying no attention to Bill's oration, took up the subject with
      enthusiasm.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She kin ride&mdash;she's a reg'lar buster to ride, ain't she, Bill?&rdquo; Bill
      nodded. &ldquo;She kin bunch cattle an' cut out an' yank a steer up to any
      cowboy on the range.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, how big is she?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Big? Why, she's just a kid! 'Tain't the bigness of her, it's the nerve.
      She's got the coldest kind of nerve you ever seen. Hain't she, Bill?&rdquo; And
      again Bill nodded.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'Member the day she dropped that steer, Bill?&rdquo; went on Hi.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What was that?&rdquo; I asked, eager for a yarn.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, nuthin',&rdquo; said Bill.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nuthin'!&rdquo; retorted Hi. &ldquo;Pretty big nuthin'!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What was it?&rdquo; I urged.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, Bill here did some funny work at old Meredith's round-up, but he
      don't speak of it. He's shy, you see,&rdquo; and Hi grinned.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, there ain't no occasion for your proceedin' onto that tact,&rdquo; said
      Bill disgustedly, and Hi loyally refrained, so I have never yet got the
      rights of the story. But from what I did hear I gathered that Bill, at the
      risk of his life, had pulled The Duke from under the hoofs of a mad steer,
      and that little Gwen had, in the coolest possible manner, &ldquo;sailed in on
      her bronco&rdquo; and, by putting two bullets into the steer's head, had saved
      them both from great danger, perhaps from death, for the rest of the
      cattle were crowding near. Of course Bill could never be persuaded to
      speak of the incident. A true western man will never hesitate to tell you
      what he can do, but of what he has done he does not readily speak.
    </p>
    <p>
      The only other item that Hi contributed to the sketch of Gwen was that her
      temper could blaze if the occasion demanded.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'Member young Hill, Bill?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Bill &ldquo;'membered.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Didn't she cut into him sudden? Sarved him right, too.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What did she do?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Cut him across the face with her quirt in good style.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What for?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Knockin' about her Indian Joe.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Joe was, as I came to learn, Ponka's son and Gwen's most devoted slave.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, she ain't no refrigerator.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; assented Bill. &ldquo;She's a leetle swift.&rdquo; Then, as if fearing he had
      been apologizing for her, he added, with the air of one settling the
      question: &ldquo;But she's good stock! She suits me!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Duke helped me to another side of her character.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She is a remarkable child,&rdquo; he said, one day. &ldquo;Wild and shy as a coyote,
      but fearless, quite; and with a heart full of passions. Meredith, the Old
      Timer, you know, has kept her up there among the hills. She sees no one
      but himself and Ponka's Blackfeet relations, who treat her like a goddess
      and help to spoil her utterly. She knows their lingo and their ways&mdash;goes
      off with them for a week at a time.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What! With the Blackfeet?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ponka and Joe, of course, go along; but even without them she is as safe
      as if surrounded by the Coldstream Guards, but she has given them up for
      some time now.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And at home?&rdquo; I asked. &ldquo;Has she any education? Can she read or write?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not she. She can make her own dresses, moccasins and leggings. She can
      cook and wash&mdash;that is, when she feels in the mood. And she knows all
      about the birds and beasts and flowers and that sort of thing, but&mdash;education!
      Why, she is hardly civilized!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What a shame!&rdquo; I said. &ldquo;How old is she?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, a mere child; fourteen or fifteen, I imagine; but a woman in many
      things.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And what does her father say to all this? Can he control her?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Control!&rdquo; said The Duke, in utter astonishment. &ldquo;Why, bless your soul,
      nothing in heaven or earth could control HER. Wait till you see her stand
      with her proud little head thrown back, giving orders to Joe, and you will
      never again connect the idea of control with Gwen. She might be a princess
      for the pride of her. I've seen some, too, in my day, but none to touch
      her for sheer, imperial pride, little Lucifer that she is.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And how does her father stand her nonsense?&rdquo; I asked, for I confess I was
      not much taken with the picture The Duke had drawn.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Her father simply follows behind her and adores, as do all things that
      come near her, down, or up, perhaps, to her two dogs&mdash;Wolf and Loo&mdash;for
      either of which she would readily die if need be. Still,&rdquo; he added, after
      a pause, &ldquo;it IS a shame, as you say. She ought to know something of the
      refinements of civilization, to which, after all, she belongs, and from
      which none of us can hope to escape.&rdquo; The Duke was silent for a few
      moments, and then added, with some hesitation: &ldquo;Then, too, she is quite a
      pagan; never saw a prayer-book, you know.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And so it came about, chiefly through The Duke's influence, I imagine,
      that I was engaged by the Old Timer to go up to his ranch every week and
      teach his daughter something of the elementaries of a lady's education.
    </p>
    <p>
      My introduction was ominous of the many things I was to suffer of that
      same young maiden before I had finished my course with her. The Old Timer
      had given careful directions as to the trail that would lead me to the
      canyon where he was to meet me. Up the Swan went the trail, winding ever
      downward into deeper and narrower coulees and up to higher open sunlit
      slopes, till suddenly it settled into a valley which began with great
      width and narrowed to a canyon whose rocky sides were dressed out with
      shrubs and trailing vines and wet with trickling rivulets from the
      numerous springs that oozed and gushed from the black, glistening rocks.
      This canyon was an eerie place of which ghostly tales were told from the
      old Blackfeet times. And to this day no Blackfoot will dare to pass
      through this black-walled, oozy, glistening canyon after the moon has
      passed the western lip. But in the warm light of broad day the canyon was
      a good enough place; cool and sweet, and I lingered through, waiting for
      the Old Timer, who failed to appear till the shadows began to darken its
      western black sides.
    </p>
    <p>
      Out of the mouth of the canyon the trail climbed to a wide stretch of
      prairie that swept up over soft hills to the left and down to the bright
      gleaming waters of the Devil's Lake on the right. In the sunlight the lake
      lay like a gem radiant with many colors, the far side black in the shadow
      of the crowding pines, then in the middle deep, blue and purple, and
      nearer, many shades of emerald that ran quite to the white, sandy beach.
      Right in front stood the ranch buildings, upon a slight rising ground and
      surrounded by a sturdy palisade of upright pointed poles. This was the
      castle of the princess. I rode up to the open gate, then turned and stood
      to look down upon the marvellous lake shining and shimmering with its many
      radiant colors. Suddenly there was an awful roar, my pony shot round upon
      his hind legs after his beastly cayuse manner, deposited me sitting upon
      the ground and fled down the trail, pursued by two huge dogs that brushed
      past me as I fell. I was aroused from my amazement by a peal of laughter,
      shrill but full of music. Turning, I saw my pupil, as I guessed, standing
      at the head of a most beautiful pinto (spotted) pony with a heavy cattle
      quirt in her hand. I scrambled to my feet and said, somewhat angrily, I
      fear:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What are you laughing at? Why don't you call back your dogs? They will
      chase my pony beyond all reach.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She lifted her little head, shook back her masses of brown-red hair,
      looked at me as if I were quite beneath contempt and said: &ldquo;No, they will
      kill him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then,&rdquo; said I, for I was very angry, &ldquo;I will kill them,&rdquo; pulling at the
      revolver in my belt.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then,&rdquo; she said, and for the first time I noticed her eyes blue-black,
      with gray rims, &ldquo;I will kill you,&rdquo; and she whipped out an ugly-looking
      revolver. From her face I had no doubt that she would not hesitate to do
      as she had said. I changed my tactics, for I was anxious about my pony,
      and said, with my best smile:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Can't you call them back? Won't they obey you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Her face changed in a moment.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is it your pony? Do you love him very much?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dearly!&rdquo; I said, persuading myself of a sudden affection for the cranky
      little brute.
    </p>
    <p>
      She sprang upon her pinto and set off down the trail. The pony was now
      coursing up and down the slopes, doubling like a hare, instinctively
      avoiding the canyon where he would be cornered. He was mad with terror at
      the huge brutes that were silently but with awful and sure swiftness
      running him down.
    </p>
    <p>
      The girl on the pinto whistled shrilly, and called to her dogs: &ldquo;Down,
      Wolf! Back, Loo!&rdquo; but, running low, with long, stretched bodies, they
      heeded not, but sped on, ever gaining upon the pony that now circled
      toward the pinto. As they drew near in their circling, the girl urged her
      pinto to meet them, loosening her lariat as she went. As the pony neared
      the pinto he slackened his speed; immediately the nearer dog gathered
      herself in two short jumps and sprang for the pony's throat. But, even as
      she sprang, the lariat whirled round the girl's head and fell swift and
      sure about the dog's neck, and next moment she lay choking upon the
      prairie. Her mate paused, looked back, and gave up the chase. But dire
      vengeance overtook them, for, like one possessed, the girl fell upon them
      with her quirt and beat them one after the other till, in pity for the
      brutes, I interposed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They shall do as I say or I shall kill them! I shall kill them!&rdquo; she
      cried, raging and stamping.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Better shoot them,&rdquo; I suggested, pulling out my pistol.
    </p>
    <p>
      Immediately she flung herself upon the one that moaned and whined at her
      feet, crying:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you dare! If you dare!&rdquo; Then she burst into passionate sobbing. &ldquo;You
      bad Loo! You bad, dear old Loo! But you WERE bad&mdash;you KNOW you were
      bad!&rdquo; and so she went on with her arms about Loo's neck till Loo, whining
      and quivering with love and delight, threatened to go quite mad, and Wolf,
      standing majestically near, broke into short howls of impatience for his
      turn of caressing. They made a strange group, those three wild things,
      equally fierce and passionate in hate and in love.
    </p>
    <p>
      Suddenly the girl remembered me, and standing up she said, half ashamed:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They always obey ME. They are MINE, but they kill any strange thing that
      comes in through the gate. They are allowed to.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is a pleasant whim.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I mean, isn't that dangerous to strangers?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, no one ever comes alone, except The Duke. And they keep off the
      wolves.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The Duke comes, does he?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes!&rdquo; and her eyes lit up. &ldquo;He is my friend. He calls me his 'princess,'
      and he teaches me to talk and tells me stories&mdash;oh, wonderful
      stories!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I looked in wonder at her face, so gentle, so girlish, and tried to think
      back to the picture of the girl who a few moments before had so coolly
      threatened to shoot me and had so furiously beaten her dogs.
    </p>
    <p>
      I kept her talking of The Duke as we walked back to the gate, watching her
      face the while. It was not beautiful; it was too thin, and the mouth was
      too large. But the teeth were good, and the eyes, blue-black with gray
      rims, looked straight at you; true eyes and brave, whether in love or in
      war. Her hair was her glory. Red it was, in spite of Hi's denial, but of
      such marvellous, indescribable shade that in certain lights, as she rode
      over the prairie, it streamed behind her like a purple banner. A most
      confusing and bewildering color, but quite in keeping with the nature of
      the owner.
    </p>
    <p>
      She gave her pinto to Joe and, standing at the door, welcomed me with a
      dignity and graciousness that made me think that The Duke was not far
      wrong when he named her &ldquo;Princess.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The door opened upon the main or living room. It was a long, apartment,
      with low ceiling and walls of hewn logs chinked and plastered and all
      beautifully whitewashed and clean. The tables, chairs and benches were all
      home-made. On the floor were magnificent skins of wolf, bear, musk ox and
      mountain goat. The walls were decorated with heads and horns of deer and
      mountain sheep, eagles' wings and a beautiful breast of a loon, which Gwen
      had shot and of which she was very proud. At one end of the room a huge
      stone fireplace stood radiant in its summer decorations of ferns and
      grasses and wild-flowers. At the other end a door opened into another
      room, smaller and richly furnished with relics of former grandeur.
    </p>
    <p>
      Everything was clean and well kept. Every nook, shelf and corner was
      decked with flowers and ferns from the canyon.
    </p>
    <p>
      A strange house it was, full of curious contrasts, but it fitted this
      quaint child that welcomed me with such gracious courtesy.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER X
    </h2>
    <h3>
      GWEN'S FIRST PRAYERS
    </h3>
    <p>
      It was with hesitation, almost with fear, that I began with Gwen; but even
      had I been able to foresee the endless series of exasperations through
      which she was destined to conduct me, still would I have undertaken my
      task. For the child, with all her wilfulness, her tempers and her pride,
      made me, as she did all others, her willing slave.
    </p>
    <p>
      Her lessons went on, brilliantly or not at all, according to her sweet
      will. She learned to read with extraordinary rapidity, for she was eager
      to know more of that great world of which The Duke had told her such
      thrilling tales. Writing she abhorred. She had no one to write to. Why
      should she cramp her fingers over these crooked little marks? But she
      mastered with hardly a struggle the mysteries of figures, for she would
      have to sell her cattle, and &ldquo;dad doesn't know when they are cheating.&rdquo;
       Her ideas of education were purely utilitarian, and what did not appear
      immediately useful she refused to trifle with. And so all through the
      following long winter she vexed my righteous soul with her wilfulness and
      pride. An appeal to her father was idle. She would wind her long, thin
      arms about his neck and let her waving red hair float over him until the
      old man was quite helpless to exert authority. The Duke could do most with
      her. To please him she would struggle with her crooked letters for an hour
      at a time, but even his influence and authority had its limits.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Must I?&rdquo; she said one day, in answer to a demand of his for more faithful
      study; &ldquo;must I?&rdquo; And throwing up her proud little head, and shaking back
      with a trick she had her streaming red hair, she looked straight at him
      from her blue-gray eyes and asked the monosyllabic question, &ldquo;Why?&rdquo; And
      The Duke looked back at her with his slight smile for a few moments and
      then said in cold, even tones:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I really don't know why,&rdquo; and turned his back on her. Immediately she
      sprang at him, shook him by the arm, and, quivering with passion, cried:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are not to speak to me like that, and you are not to turn your back
      that way!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What a little princess it is,&rdquo; he said admiringly, &ldquo;and what a time she
      will give herself some day!&rdquo; Then he added, smiling sadly: &ldquo;Was I rude,
      Gwen? Then I am sorry.&rdquo; Her rage was gone, and she looked as if she could
      have held him by the feet. As it was, too proud to show her feelings, she
      just looked at him with softening eyes, and then sat down to the work she
      had refused. This was after the advent of The Pilot at Swan Creek, and, as
      The Duke rode home with me that night, after long musing he said with
      hesitation: &ldquo;She ought to have some religion, poor child; she will grow up
      a perfect little devil. The Pilot might be of service if you could bring
      him up. Women need that sort of thing; it refines, you know.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Would she have him?&rdquo; I asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Question,&rdquo; he replied, doubtfully. &ldquo;You might suggest it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Which I did, introducing somewhat clumsily, I fear, The Duke's name.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The Duke says he is to make me good!&rdquo; she cried. &ldquo;I won't have him, I
      hate him and you too!&rdquo; And for that day she disdained all lessons, and
      when The Duke next appeared she greeted him with the exclamation, &ldquo;I won't
      have your old Pilot, and I don't want to be good, and&mdash;and&mdash;you
      think he's no good yourself,&rdquo; at which the Duke opened his eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How do you know? I never said so!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You laughed at him to dad one day.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did I?&rdquo; said The Duke, gravely. &ldquo;Then I hasten to assure, you that I have
      changed my mind. He is a good, brave man.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He falls off his horse,&rdquo; she said, with contempt.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I rather think he sticks on now,&rdquo; replied The Duke, repressing a smile.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Besides,&rdquo; she went on, &ldquo;he's just a kid; Bill said so.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, he might be more ancient,&rdquo; acknowledged The Duke, &ldquo;but in that he
      is steadily improving.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Anyway,&rdquo; with an air of finality, &ldquo;he is not to come here.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But he did come, and under her own escort, one threatening August evening.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I found him in the creek,&rdquo; she announced, with defiant shamefacedness,
      marching in The Pilot half drowned.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think I could have crossed,&rdquo; he said, apologetically, &ldquo;for Louis was
      getting on his feet again.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, you wouldn't,&rdquo; she protested. &ldquo;You would have been down into the
      canyon by now, and you ought to be thankful.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So I am,&rdquo; he hastened to say, &ldquo;very! But,&rdquo; he added, unwilling to give up
      his contention, &ldquo;I have crossed the Swan before.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not when it was in flood.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, when it was in flood, higher than now.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not where the banks are rocky.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No-o!&rdquo; he hesitated.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There, then, you WOULD have been drowned but for my lariat!&rdquo; she cried,
      triumphantly.
    </p>
    <p>
      To this he doubtfully assented.
    </p>
    <p>
      They were much alike, in high temper, in enthusiasm, in vivid imagination,
      and in sensitive feeling. When the Old Timer came in Gwen triumphantly
      introduced The Pilot as having been rescued from a watery grave by her
      lariat, and again they fought out the possibilities of drowning and of
      escape till Gwen almost lost her temper, and was appeased only by the most
      profuse expressions of gratitude on the part of The Pilot for her timely
      assistance. The Old Timer was perplexed. He was afraid to offend Gwen and
      yet unwilling to be cordial to her guest. The Pilot was quick to feel
      this, and, soon after tea, rose to go. Gwen's disappointment showed in her
      face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ask him to stay, dad,&rdquo; she said, in a whisper. But the half-hearted
      invitation acted like a spur, and The Pilot was determined to set off.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There's a bad storm coming,&rdquo; she said; &ldquo;and besides,&rdquo; she added,
      triumphantly &ldquo;you can't cross the Swan.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This settled it, and the most earnest prayers of the Old Timer could not
      have held him back.
    </p>
    <p>
      We all went down to see him cross, Gwen leading her pinto. The Swan was
      far over its banks, and in the middle running swift and strong. Louis
      snorted, refused and finally plunged. Bravely he swam, till the
      swift-running water struck him, and over he went on his side, throwing his
      rider into the water. But The Pilot kept his head, and, holding by the
      stirrups, paddled along by Louis' side. When they were half-way across
      Louis saw that he had no chance of making the landing; so, like a sensible
      horse, he turned and made for the shore. Here, too, the banks were high,
      and the pony began to grow discouraged.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let him float down further!&rdquo; shrieked Gwen, in anxious excitement; and,
      urging her pinto down the bank, she coaxed the struggling pony down the
      stream till opposite a shelf of rock level with the high water. Then she
      threw her lariat, and, catching Louis about the neck and the horn of his
      saddle, she held taut, till, half drowned, he scrambled up the bank,
      dragging The Pilot with him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I'm so glad!&rdquo; she said, almost tearfully. &ldquo;You see, you couldn't get
      across.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Pilot staggered to his feet, took a step toward her, gasped out:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I can!&rdquo; and pitched headlong. With a little cry she flew to him, and
      turned him over on his back. In a few moments he revived, sat up, and
      looked about stupidly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where's Louis?&rdquo; he said, with his face toward the swollen stream.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Safe enough,&rdquo; she answered; &ldquo;but you must come in, the rain is just going
      to pour.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But The Pilot seemed possessed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, I'm going across,&rdquo; he said, rising.
    </p>
    <p>
      Gwen was greatly distressed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But your poor horse,&rdquo; she said, cleverly changing her ground; &ldquo;he is
      quite tired out.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Old Timer now joined earnestly in urging him to stay till the storm
      was past. So, with a final look at the stream, The Pilot turned toward the
      house.
    </p>
    <p>
      Of course I knew what would happen. Before the evening was over he had
      captured the household. The moment he appeared with dry things on he ran
      to the organ, that had stood for ten years closed and silent, opened it
      and began to play. As he played and sang song after song, the Old Timer's
      eyes began to glisten under his shaggy brows. But when he dropped into the
      exquisite Irish melody, &ldquo;Oft in the Stilly Night,&rdquo; the old man drew a hard
      breath and groaned out to me:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It was her mother's song,&rdquo; and from that time The Pilot had him fast. It
      was easy to pass to the old hymn, &ldquo;Nearer, My God, to Thee,&rdquo; and then The
      Pilot said simply, &ldquo;May we have prayers?&rdquo; He looked at Gwen, but she gazed
      blankly at him and then at her father.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What does he say, dad?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It was pitiful to see the old man's face grow slowly red under the deep
      tan, as he said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You may, sir. There's been none here for many years, and the worse for
      us.&rdquo; He rose slowly, went into the inner room and returned with a Bible.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's her mother's,&rdquo; he said, in a voice deep with emotion. &ldquo;I put it in
      her trunk the day I laid her out yonder under the pines.&rdquo; The Pilot,
      without looking at him, rose and reverently took the book in both his
      hands and said gently:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It was a sad day for you, but for her&mdash;&rdquo; He paused. &ldquo;You did not
      grudge it to her?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not now, but then, yes! I wanted her, we needed her.&rdquo; The Old Timer's
      tears were flowing.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Pilot put his hand caressingly upon the old man's shoulder as if he
      had been his father, and said in his clear, sweet voice, &ldquo;Some day you
      will go to her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Upon this scene poor Gwen gazed with eyes wide open with amazement and a
      kind of fear. She had never seen her father weep since the awful day that
      she could never forget, when he had knelt in dumb agony beside the bed on
      which her mother lay white and still; nor would he heed her till, climbing
      up, she tried to make her mother waken and hear her cries. Then he had
      caught her up in his arms, pressing her with tears and great sobs to his
      heart. To-night she seemed to feel that something was wrong. She went and
      stood by her father, and, stroking his gray hair kindly, she said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is he saying, daddy? Is he making you cry?&rdquo; She looked at The Pilot
      defiantly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, no, child,&rdquo; said the old man, hastily, &ldquo;sit here and listen.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And while the storm raved outside we three sat listening to that ancient
      story of love ineffable. And, as the words fell like sweet music upon our
      ears, the old man sat with eyes that looked far away, while the child
      listened with devouring eagerness.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is it a fairy tale, daddy?&rdquo; she asked, as The Pilot paused. &ldquo;It isn't
      true, is it?&rdquo; and her voice had a pleading note hard for the old man to
      bear.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, yes, my child,&rdquo; said he, brokenly. &ldquo;God forgive me!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course it's true,&rdquo; said The Pilot, quickly. &ldquo;I'll read it all to you
      to-morrow. It's a beautiful story!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; she said, imperiously, &ldquo;to-night. Read it now! Go on!&rdquo; she said,
      stamping her foot, &ldquo;don't you hear me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Pilot gazed in surprise at her, and then turning to the old man, said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Shall I?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Old Timer simply nodded and the reading went on. Those were not my
      best days, and the faith of my childhood was not as it had been; but, as
      The Pilot carried us through those matchless scenes of self-forgetting
      love and service the rapt wonder in the child's face as she listened, the
      appeal in her voice as, now to her father, and now to me, she cried: &ldquo;Is
      THAT true, too? Is it ALL true?&rdquo; made it impossible for me to hesitate in
      my answer. And I was glad to find it easy to give my firm adherence to the
      truth of all that tale of wonder. And, as more and more it grew upon The
      Pilot that the story he was reading, so old to him and to all he had ever
      met, was new to one in that listening group, his face began to glow and
      his eyes to blaze, and he saw and showed me things that night I had never
      seen before, nor have I seen them since. The great figure of the Gospels
      lived, moved before our eyes. We saw Him bend to touch the blind, we heard
      Him speak His marvellous teaching, we felt the throbbing excitement of the
      crowds that pressed against Him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Suddenly The Pilot stopped, turned over the leaves and began again: &ldquo;And
      He led them out as far as to Bethany. And He lifted up His hands and
      blessed them. And it came to pass as He blessed them He was parted from
      them and a cloud received Him out of their sight.&rdquo; There was silence for
      some minutes, then Gwen said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where did He go?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Up into Heaven,&rdquo; answered The Pilot, simply.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That's where mother is,&rdquo; she said to her father, who nodded in reply.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Does He know?&rdquo; she asked. The old man looked distressed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course He does,&rdquo; said The Pilot, &ldquo;and she sees Him all the time.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, daddy!&rdquo; she cried, &ldquo;isn't that good?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But the old man only hid his face in his hands and groaned.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; went on The Pilot, &ldquo;and He sees us, too, and hears us speak, and
      knows our thoughts.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Again the look of wonder and fear came into her eyes, but she said no
      word. The experiences of the evening had made the world new to her. It
      could never be the same to her again. It gave me a queer feeling to see
      her, when we three kneeled to pray, stand helplessly looking on, not
      knowing what to do, then sink beside her father, and, winding her arms
      about his neck, cling to him as the words of prayer were spoken into the
      ear of Him whom no man can see, but who we believe is near to all that
      call upon Him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Those were Gwen's first &ldquo;prayers,&rdquo; and in them Gwen's part was small, for
      fear and wonder filled her heart; but the day was to come, and all too
      soon, when she should have to pour out her soul with strong crying and
      tears. That day came and passed, but the story of it is not to be told
      here.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XI
    </h2>
    <h3>
      GWEN'S CHALLENGE
    </h3>
    <p>
      Gwen was undoubtedly wild and, as The Sky Pilot said, wilful and wicked.
      Even Bronco Bill and Hi Kendal would say so, without, of course, abating
      one jot of their admiration for her. For fourteen years she had lived
      chiefly with wild things. The cattle on the range, wild as deer, the
      coyotes, the jack-rabbits and the timber wolves were her mates and her
      instructors. From these she learned her wild ways. The rolling prairie of
      the Foothill country was her home. She loved it and all things that moved
      upon it with passionate love, the only kind she was capable of. And all
      summer long she spent her days riding up and down the range alone, or with
      her father, or with Joe, or, best of all, with The Duke, her hero and her
      friend. So she grew up strong, wholesome and self-reliant, fearing nothing
      alive and as untamed as a yearling range colt.
    </p>
    <p>
      She was not beautiful. The winds and sun had left her no complexion to
      speak of, but the glory of her red hair, gold-red, with purple sheen,
      nothing could tarnish. Her eyes, too, deep blue with rims of gray, that
      flashed with the glint of steel or shone with melting light as of the
      stars, according to her mood&mdash;those Irish, warm, deep eyes of hers
      were worth a man's looking at.
    </p>
    <p>
      Of course, all spoiled her. Ponka and her son Joe grovelled in abjectest
      adoration, while her father and all who came within touch of her simply
      did her will. Even The Duke, who loved her better than anything else,
      yielded lazy, admiring homage to his Little Princess, and certainly, when
      she stood straight up with her proud little gold-crowned head thrown back,
      flashing forth wrath or issuing imperious commands, she looked a princess,
      all of her.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was a great day and a good day for her when she fished The Sky Pilot
      out of the Swan and brought him home, and the night of Gwen's first
      &ldquo;prayers,&rdquo; when she heard for the first time the story of the Man of
      Nazareth, was the best of all her nights up to that time. All through the
      winter, under The Pilot's guidance, she, with her father, the Old Timer,
      listening near, went over and over that story so old now to many, but ever
      becoming new, till a whole new world of mysterious Powers and Presences
      lay open to her imagination and became the home of great realities. She
      was rich in imagination and, when The Pilot read Bunyan's immortal poem,
      her mother's old &ldquo;Pilgrim's Progress,&rdquo; she moved and lived beside the hero
      of that tale, backing him up in his fights and consumed with anxiety over
      his many impending perils, till she had him safely across the river and
      delivered into the charge of the shining ones.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Pilot himself, too, was a new and wholesome experience. He was the
      first thing she had yet encountered that refused submission, and the first
      human being that had failed to fall down and worship. There was something
      in him that would not ALWAYS yield, and, indeed, her pride and her
      imperious tempers he met with surprise and sometimes with a pity that
      verged toward contempt. With this she was not well pleased and not
      infrequently she broke forth upon him. One of these outbursts is stamped
      upon my mind, not only because of its unusual violence, but chiefly
      because of the events which followed. The original cause of her rage was
      some trifling misdeed of the unfortunate Joe; but when I came upon the
      scene it was The Pilot who was occupying her attention. The expression of
      surprise and pity on his face appeared to stir her up.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How dare you look at me like that?&rdquo; she cried.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How very extraordinary that you can't keep hold of yourself better!&rdquo; he
      answered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I can!&rdquo; she stamped, &ldquo;and I shall do as I like!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is a great pity,&rdquo; he said, with provoking calm, &ldquo;and besides, it is
      weak and silly.&rdquo; His words were unfortunate.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Weak!&rdquo; she gasped, when her breath came back to her. &ldquo;Weak!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;very weak and childish.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then she could have cheerfully put him to a slow and cruel death. When she
      had recovered a little she cried vehemently:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'm not weak! I'm strong! I'm stronger than you are! I'm strong as&mdash;as&mdash;a
      man!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I do not suppose she meant the insinuation; at any rate The Pilot ignored
      it and went on.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You're not strong enough to keep your temper down.&rdquo; And then, as she had
      no reply ready, he went on, &ldquo;And really, Gwen, it is not right. You must
      not go on in this way.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Again his words were unfortunate.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;MUST NOT!&rdquo; she cried, adding an inch to her height. &ldquo;Who says so?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;God!&rdquo; was the simple, short answer.
    </p>
    <p>
      She was greatly taken back, and gave a quick glance over her shoulder as
      if to see Him, who would dare to say MUST NOT to her; but, recovering, she
      answered sullenly:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't care!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don't care for God?&rdquo; The Pilot's voice was quiet and solemn, but
      something in his manner angered her, and she blazed forth again.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't care for anyone, and I SHALL do as I like.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Pilot looked at her sadly for a moment, and then said slowly:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Some day, Gwen, you will not be able to do as you like.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I remember well the settled defiance in her tone and manner as she took a
      step nearer him and answered in a voice trembling with passion:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Listen! I have always done as I like, and I shall do as I like till I
      die!&rdquo; And she rushed forth from the house and down toward the canyon, her
      refuge from all disturbing things, and chiefly from herself.
    </p>
    <p>
      I could not shake off the impression her words made upon me. &ldquo;Pretty
      direct, that,&rdquo; I said to The Pilot, as we rode away. &ldquo;The declaration may
      be philosophically correct, but it rings uncommonly like a challenge to
      the Almighty. Throws down the gauntlet, so to speak.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But The Pilot only said, &ldquo;Don't! How can you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Within a week her challenge was accepted, and how fiercely and how
      gallantly did she struggle to make it good!
    </p>
    <p>
      It was The Duke that brought me the news, and as he told me the story his
      gay, careless self-command for once was gone. For in the gloom of the
      canyon where he overtook me I could see his face gleaming out ghastly
      white, and even his iron nerve could not keep the tremor from his voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I've just sent up the doctor,&rdquo; was his answer to my greeting. &ldquo;I looked
      for you last night, couldn't find you, and so rode off to the Fort.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What's up?&rdquo; I said, with fear in my heart, for no light thing moved The
      Duke.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Haven't you heard? It's Gwen,&rdquo; he said, and the next minute or two he
      gave to Jingo, who was indulging in a series of unexpected plunges. When
      Jingo was brought down, The Duke was master of himself and told his tale
      with careful self-control.
    </p>
    <p>
      Gwen, on her father's buckskin bronco, had gone with The Duke to the big
      plain above the cut-bank where Joe was herding the cattle. The day was hot
      and a storm was in the air. They found Joe riding up and down, singing to
      keep the cattle quiet, but having a hard time to hold the bunch from
      breaking. While The Duke was riding around the far side of the bunch, a
      cry from Gwen arrested his attention. Joe was in trouble. His horse, a
      half-broken cayuse, had stumbled into a badger-hole and had bolted,
      leaving Joe to the mercy of the cattle. At once they began to sniff
      suspiciously at this phenomenon, a man on foot, and to follow cautiously
      on his track. Joe kept his head and walked slowly out, till all at once a
      young cow began to bawl and to paw the ground. In another minute one, and
      then another of the cattle began to toss their heads and bunch and bellow
      till the whole herd of two hundred were after Joe. Then Joe lost his head
      and ran. Immediately the whole herd broke into a thundering gallop with
      heads and tails aloft and horns rattling like the loading of a regiment of
      rifles.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Two more minutes,&rdquo; said The Duke, &ldquo;would have done for Joe, for I could
      never have reached him; but, in spite of my most frantic warnings and
      signalings, right into the face of that mad, bellowing, thundering mass of
      steers rode that little girl. Nerve! I have some myself, but I couldn't
      have done it. She swung her horse round Joe and sailed out with him, with
      the herd bellowing at the tail of her bronco. I've seen some cavalry
      things in my day, but for sheer cool bravery nothing touches that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How did it end? Did they run them down?&rdquo; I asked, with terror at such a
      result.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, they crowded her toward the cut-bank, and she was edging them off and
      was almost past, when they came to a place where the bank bit in, and her
      iron-mouthed brute wouldn't swerve, but went pounding on, broke through,
      plunged; she couldn't spring free because of Joe, and pitched headlong
      over the bank, while the cattle went thundering past. I flung myself off
      Jingo and slid down somehow into the sand, thirty feet below. Here was Joe
      safe enough, but the bronco lay with a broken leg, and half under him was
      Gwen. She hardly knew she was hurt, but waved her hand to me and cried
      out, 'Wasn't that a race? I couldn't swing this hard-headed brute. Get me
      out.' But even as she spoke the light faded from her eyes, she stretched
      out her hands to me, saying faintly, 'Oh, Duke,' and lay back white and
      still. We put a bullet into the buckskin's head, and carried her home in
      our jackets, and there she lies without a sound from her poor, white
      lips.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Duke was badly cut up. I had never seen him show any sign of grief
      before, but as he finished the story he stood ghastly and shaking. He read
      my surprise in my face and said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Look here, old chap, don't think me quite a fool. You can't know what
      that little girl has done for me these years. Her trust in me&mdash;it is
      extraordinary how utterly she trusts me&mdash;somehow held me up to my
      best and back from perdition. It is the one bright spot in my life in this
      blessed country. Everyone else thinks me a pleasant or unpleasant kind of
      fiend.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I protested rather faintly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, don't worry your conscience,&rdquo; he answered, with a slight return of
      his old smile, &ldquo;a fuller knowledge would only justify the opinion.&rdquo; Then,
      after a pause, he added: &ldquo;But if Gwen goes, I must pull out, I could not
      stand it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      As we rode up, the doctor came out.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, what do you think?&rdquo; asked The Duke.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Can't say yet,&rdquo; replied the old doctor, gruff with long army practice,
      &ldquo;bad enough. Good night.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But The Duke's hand fell upon his shoulder with a grip that must have got
      to the bone, and in a husky voice he asked:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Will she live?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The doctor squirmed, but could not shake off that crushing grip.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Here, you young tiger, let go! What do you think I am made of?&rdquo; he cried,
      angrily. &ldquo;I didn't suppose I was coming to a bear's den, or I should have
      brought a gun.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It was only by the most complete apology that The Duke could mollify the
      old doctor sufficiently to get his opinion.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, she will not die! Great bit of stuff! Better she should die, perhaps!
      But can't say yet for two weeks. Now remember,&rdquo; he added sharply, looking
      into The Duke's woe-stricken face, &ldquo;her spirits must be kept up. I have
      lied most fully and cheerfully to them inside; you must do the same,&rdquo; and
      the doctor strode away, calling out:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Joe! Here, Joe! Where is he gone? Joe, I say! Extraordinary selection
      Providence makes at times; we could have spared that lazy half-breed with
      pleasure! Joe! Oh, here you are! Where in thunder&mdash;&rdquo; But here the
      doctor stopped abruptly. The agony in the dark face before him was too
      much even for the bluff doctor. Straight and stiff Joe stood by the
      horse's head till the doctor had mounted, then with a great effort he
      said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Little miss, she go dead?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dead!&rdquo; called out the doctor, glancing at the open window. &ldquo;Why, bless
      your old copper carcass, no! Gwen will show you yet how to rope a steer.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Joe took a step nearer, and lowering his tone said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You speak me true? Me man, Me no papoose.&rdquo; The piercing black eyes
      searched the doctor's face. The doctor hesitated a moment, and then, with
      an air of great candor, said cheerily:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That's all right, Joe. Miss Gwen will cut circles round your old cayuse
      yet. But remember,&rdquo; and the doctor was very impressive, &ldquo;you must make her
      laugh every day.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Joe folded his arms across his breast and stood like a statue till the
      doctor rode away; then turning to us he grunted out:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Him good man, eh?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good man,&rdquo; answered The Duke, adding, &ldquo;but remember, Joe, what he told
      you to do. Must make her laugh every day.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Poor Joe! Humor was not his forte, and his attempt in this direction in
      the weeks that followed would have been humorous were they not so
      pathetic. How I did my part I cannot tell. Those weeks are to me now like
      the memory of an ugly nightmare. The ghostly old man moving out and in of
      his little daughter's room in useless, dumb agony; Ponka's woe-stricken
      Indian face; Joe's extraordinary and unusual but loyal attempts at
      fun-making grotesquely sad, and The Duke's unvarying and invincible
      cheeriness; these furnish light and shade for the picture my memory brings
      me of Gwen in those days.
    </p>
    <p>
      For the first two weeks she was simply heroic. She bore her pain without a
      groan, submitted to the imprisonment which was harder than pain with
      angelic patience. Joe, The Duke and I carried out our instructions with
      careful exactness to the letter. She never doubted, and we never let her
      doubt but that in a few weeks she would be on the pinto's back again and
      after the cattle. She made us pass our word for this till it seemed as if
      she must have read the falsehoods on our brows.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To lie cheerfully with her eyes upon one's face calls for more than I
      possess,&rdquo; said The Duke one day. &ldquo;The doctor should supply us tonics. It
      is an arduous task.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And she believed us absolutely, and made plans for the fall &ldquo;round-up,&rdquo;
       and for hunts and rides till one's heart grew sick. As to the ethical
      problem involved, I decline to express an opinion, but we had no need to
      wait for our punishment. Her trust in us, her eager and confident
      expectation of the return of her happy, free, outdoor life; these brought
      to us, who knew how vain they were, their own adequate punishment for
      every false assurance we gave. And how bright and brave she was those
      first days! How resolute to get back to the world of air and light
      outside!
    </p>
    <p>
      But she had need of all her brightness and courage and resolution before
      she was done with her long fight.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XII
    </h2>
    <h3>
      GWEN'S CANYON
    </h3>
    <p>
      Gwen's hope and bright courage, in spite of all her pain, were wonderful
      to witness. But all this cheery hope and courage and patience snuffed out
      as a candle, leaving noisome darkness to settle down in that sick-room
      from the day of the doctor's consultation.
    </p>
    <p>
      The verdict was clear and final. The old doctor, who loved Gwen as his
      own, was inclined to hope against hope, but Fawcett, the clever young
      doctor from the distant town, was positive in his opinion. The scene is
      clear to me now, after many years. We three stood in the outer room; The
      Duke and her father were with Gwen. So earnest was the discussion that
      none of us heard the door open just as young Fawcett was saying in
      incisive tones:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No! I can see no hope. The child can never walk again.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There was a cry behind us.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What! Never walk again! It's a lie!&rdquo; There stood the Old Timer, white,
      fierce, shaking.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hush!&rdquo; said the old doctor, pointing at the open door. He was too late.
      Even as he spoke, there came from the inner room a wild, unearthly cry as
      of some dying thing and, as we stood gazing at one another with
      awe-stricken faces, we heard Gwen's voice as in quick, sharp pain.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Daddy! daddy! come! What do they say? Tell me, daddy. It is not true! It
      is not true! Look at me, daddy!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She pulled up her father's haggard face from the bed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, daddy, daddy, you know it's true. Never walk again!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She turned with a pitiful cry to The Duke, who stood white and stiff with
      arms drawn tight across his breast on the other side of the bed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, Duke, did you hear them? You told me to be brave, and I tried not to
      cry when they hurt me. But I can't be brave! Can I, Duke? Oh, Duke! Never
      to ride again!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She stretched out her hands to him. But The Duke, leaning over her and
      holding her hands fast in his, could only say brokenly over and over:
      &ldquo;Don't, Gwen! Don't, Gwen dear!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But the pitiful, pleading voice went on.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, Duke! Must I always lie here? Must, I? Why must I?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;God knows,&rdquo; answered The Duke bitterly, under his breath, &ldquo;I don't!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She caught at the word.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Does He?&rdquo; she cried, eagerly. Then she paused suddenly, turned to me and
      said: &ldquo;Do you remember he said some day I could not do as I liked?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I was puzzled.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The Pilot,&rdquo; she cried, impatiently, &ldquo;don't you remember? And I said I
      should do as I liked till I died.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I nodded my head and said: &ldquo;But you know you didn't mean it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But I did, and I do,&rdquo; she cried, with passionate vehemence, &ldquo;and I will
      do as I like! I will not lie here! I will ride! I will! I will! I will!&rdquo;
       and she struggled up, clenched her fists, and sank back faint and weak. It
      was not a pleasant sight, but gruesome. Her rage against that Unseen
      Omnipotence was so defiant and so helpless.
    </p>
    <p>
      Those were dreadful weeks to Gwen and to all about her. The constant pain
      could not break her proud spirit; she shed no tears; but she fretted and
      chafed and grew more imperiously exacting every day. Ponka and Joe she
      drove like a slave master, and even her father, when he could not
      understand her wishes, she impatiently banished from her room. Only The
      Duke could please or bring her any cheer, and even The Duke began to feel
      that the day was not far off when he, too, would fail, and the thought
      made him despair. Her pain was hard to bear, but harder than the pain was
      her longing for the open air and the free, flower-strewn, breeze-swept
      prairie. But most pitiful of all were the days when, in her utter
      weariness and uncontrollable unrest, she would pray to be taken down into
      the canyon.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, it is so cool and shady,&rdquo; she would plead, &ldquo;and the flowers up in the
      rocks and the vines and things are all so lovely. I am always better
      there. I know I should be better,&rdquo; till The Duke would be distracted and
      would come to me and wonder what the end would be.
    </p>
    <p>
      One day, when the strain had been more terrible than usual, The Duke rode
      down to me and said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Look here, this thing can't go on. Where is The Pilot gone? Why doesn't
      he stay where he belongs? I wish to Heaven he would get through with his
      absurd rambling.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He's gone where he was sent,&rdquo; I replied shortly. &ldquo;You don't set much
      store by him when he does come round. He is gone on an exploring trip
      through the Dog Lake country. He'll be back by the end of next week.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I say, bring him up, for Heaven's sake,&rdquo; said The Duke, &ldquo;he may be of
      some use, and anyway it will be a new face for her, poor child.&rdquo; Then he
      added, rather penitently: &ldquo;I fear this thing is getting on to my nerves.
      She almost drove me out to-day. Don't lay it up against me, old chap.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It was a new thing to hear The Duke confess his need of any man, much less
      penitence for a fault. I felt my eyes growing dim, but I said, roughly:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You be hanged! I'll bring The Pilot up when he comes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It was wonderful how we had all come to confide in The Pilot during his
      year of missionary work among us. Somehow the cowboy's name of &ldquo;Sky Pilot&rdquo;
       seemed to express better than anything else the place he held with us.
      Certain it is, that when, in their dark hours, any of the fellows felt in
      need of help to strike the &ldquo;upward trail,&rdquo; they went to The Pilot; and so
      the name first given in chaff came to be the name that expressed most
      truly the deep and tender feeling these rough, big-hearted men cherished
      for him. When The Pilot came home I carefully prepared him for his trial,
      telling all that Gwen had suffered and striving to make him feel how
      desperate was her case when even The Duke had to confess himself beaten.
      He did not seem sufficiently impressed. Then I pictured for him all her
      fierce wilfulness and her fretful humors, her impatience with those who
      loved her and were wearing out their souls and bodies for her. &ldquo;In short,&rdquo;
       I concluded, &ldquo;she doesn't care a rush for anything in heaven or earth, and
      will yield to neither man nor God.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Pilot's eyes had been kindling as I talked, but he only answered,
      quietly:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What could you expect?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I do think she might show some signs of gratitude and some
      gentleness towards those ready to die for her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, you do!&rdquo; said he, with high scorn. &ldquo;You all combine to ruin her
      temper and disposition with foolish flattery and weak yielding to her
      whims, right or wrong; you smile at her imperious pride and encourage her
      wilfulness, and then not only wonder at the results, but blame her, poor
      child, for all. Oh, you are a fine lot, The Duke and all of you!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He had a most exasperating ability for putting one in the wrong, and I
      could only think of the proper and sufficient reply long after the
      opportunity for making it had passed. I wondered what The Duke would say
      to this doctrine. All the following day, which was Sunday, I could see
      that Gwen was on The Pilot's mind. He was struggling with the problem of
      pain.
    </p>
    <p>
      Monday morning found us on the way to the Old Timer's ranch. And what a
      morning it was! How beautiful our world seemed! About us rolled the
      round-topped, velvet hills, brown and yellow or faintly green, spreading
      out behind us to the broad prairie, and before, clambering up and up to
      meet the purple bases of the great mountains that lay their mighty length
      along the horizon and thrust up white, sunlit peaks into the blue sky. On
      the hillsides and down in the sheltering hollows we could see the bunches
      of cattle and horses feeding upon the rich grasses. High above, the sky,
      cloudless and blue, arched its great kindly roof from prairie to mountain
      peaks, and over all, above, below, upon prairie, hillsides and mountains,
      the sun poured his floods of radiant yellow light.
    </p>
    <p>
      As we followed the trail that wound up and into the heart of these rounded
      hills and ever nearer to the purple mountains, the morning breeze swept
      down to meet us, bearing a thousand scents, and filling us with its own
      fresh life. One can know the quickening joyousness of these Foothill
      breezes only after he has drunk with wide-open mouth, deep and full of
      them.
    </p>
    <p>
      Through all this mingling beauty of sunlit hills and shady hollows and
      purple, snow-peaked mountains, we rode with hardly a word, every minute
      adding to our heart-filling delight, but ever with the thought of the
      little room where, shut in from all this outside glory, lay Gwen,
      heart-sore with fretting and longing. This must have been in The Pilot's
      mind, for he suddenly held up his horse and burst out:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Poor Gwen, how she loves all this!&mdash;it is her very life. How can she
      help fretting the heart out of her? To see this no more!&rdquo; He flung himself
      off his bronco and said, as if thinking aloud: &ldquo;It is too awful! Oh, it is
      cruel! I don't wonder at her! God help me, what can I say to her?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He threw himself down upon the grass and turned over on his face. After a
      few minutes he appealed to me, and his face was sorely troubled.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How can one go to her? It seems to me sheerest mockery to speak of
      patience and submission to a wild young thing from whom all this is
      suddenly snatched forever&mdash;and this was very life to her, too,
      remember.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then he sprang up and we rode hard for an hour, till we came to the mouth
      of the canyon. Here the trail grew difficult and we came to a walk. As we
      went down into the cool depths the spirit of the canyon came to meet us
      and took The Pilot in its grip. He rode in front, feasting his eyes on all
      the wonders in that storehouse of beauty. Trees of many kinds deepened the
      shadows of the canyon. Over us waved the big elms that grew up here and
      there out of the bottom, and around their feet clustered low cedars and
      hemlocks and balsams, while the sturdy, rugged oaks and delicate,
      trembling poplars clung to the rocky sides and clambered up and out to the
      canyon's sunny lips. Back of all, the great black rocks, decked with mossy
      bits and clinging things, glistened cool and moist between the parting
      trees. From many an oozy nook the dainty clematis and columbine shook out
      their bells, and, lower down, from beds of many-colored moss the late
      wind-flower and maiden-hair and tiny violet lifted up brave, sweet faces.
      And through the canyon the Little Swan sang its song to rocks and flowers
      and overhanging trees, a song of many tones, deep-booming where it took
      its first sheer plunge, gay-chattering where it threw itself down the
      ragged rocks, and soft-murmuring where it lingered about the roots of the
      loving, listening elms. A cool, sweet, soothing place it was, with all its
      shades and sounds and silences, and, lest it should be sad to any, the
      sharp, quick sunbeams danced and laughed down through all its leaves upon
      mosses, flowers and rocks. No wonder that The Pilot, drawing a deep breath
      as he touched the prairie sod again, said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That does me good. It is better at times even than the sunny hills. This
      was Gwen's best spot.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I saw that the canyon had done its work with him. His face was strong and
      calm as the hills on a summer morning, and with this face he looked in
      upon Gwen. It was one of her bad days and one of her bad moods, but like a
      summer breeze he burst into the little room.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, Gwen!&rdquo; he cried, without a word of greeting, much less of
      Commiseration, &ldquo;we have had such a ride!&rdquo; And he spread out the sunlit,
      round-topped hills before her, till I could feel their very breezes in my
      face. This The Duke had never dared to do, fearing to grieve her with
      pictures of what she should look upon no more. But, as The Pilot talked,
      before she knew, Gwen was out again upon her beloved hills, breathing
      their fresh, sunny air, filling her heart with their multitudinous
      delights, till her eyes grew bright and the lines of fretting smoothed out
      of her face and she forgot her pain. Then, before she could remember, he
      had her down into the canyon, feasting her heart with its airs and sights
      and sounds. The black, glistening rocks, tricked out with moss and
      trailing vines, the great elms and low green cedars, the oaks and
      shivering poplars, the clematis and columbine hanging from the rocky
      nooks, and the violets and maiden-hair deep bedded in their mosses. All
      this and far more he showed her with a touch so light as not to shake the
      morning dew from bell or leaf or frond, and with a voice so soft and full
      of music as to fill our hearts with the canyon's mingling sounds, and, as
      I looked upon her face, I said to myself: &ldquo;Dear old Pilot! for this I
      shall always love you well.&rdquo; As poor Gwen listened, the rapture of it drew
      the big tears down her cheeks&mdash;alas! no longer brown, but white, and
      for that day at least the dull, dead weariness was lifted from her heart.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XIII
    </h2>
    <h3>
      THE CANYON FLOWERS
    </h3>
    <p>
      The Pilot's first visit to Gwen had been a triumph. But none knew better
      than he that the fight was still to come, for deep in Gwen's heart were
      thoughts whose pain made her forget all other.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Was it God let me fall?&rdquo; she asked abruptly one day, and The Pilot knew
      the fight was on; but he only answered, looking fearlessly into her eyes:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, Gwen dear.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why did He let me fall?&rdquo; and her voice was very deliberate.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't know, Gwen dear,&rdquo; said The Pilot steadily. &ldquo;He knows.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And does He know I shall never ride again? Does He know how long the days
      are, and the nights when I can't sleep? Does He know?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, Gwen dear,&rdquo; said The Pilot, and the tears were standing in his eyes,
      though his voice was still steady enough.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are you sure He knows?&rdquo; The voice was painfully intense.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Listen to me, Gwen,&rdquo; began The Pilot, in great distress, but she cut him
      short.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are you quite sure He knows? Answer me!&rdquo; she cried, with her old
      imperiousness.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, Gwen, He knows all about you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then what do you think of Him, just because He's big and strong, treating
      a little girl that way?&rdquo; Then she added, viciously: &ldquo;I hate Him! I don't
      care! I hate Him!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But The Pilot did not wince. I wondered how he would solve that problem
      that was puzzling, not only Gwen, but her father and The Duke, and all of
      us&mdash;the WHY of human pain.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Gwen,&rdquo; said The Pilot, as if changing the subject, &ldquo;did it hurt to put on
      the plaster jacket?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You just bet!&rdquo; said Gwen, lapsing in her English, as The Duke was not
      present; &ldquo;it was worse than anything&mdash;awful! They had to straighten
      me out, you know,&rdquo; and she shuddered at the memory of that pain.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What a pity your father or The Duke was not here!&rdquo; said The Pilot,
      earnestly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, they were both here!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What a cruel shame!&rdquo; burst out The Pilot. &ldquo;Don't they care for you any
      more?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course they do,&rdquo; said Gwen, indignantly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why didn't they stop the doctors from hurting you so cruelly?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, they let the doctors. It is going to help me to sit up and perhaps
      to walk about a little,&rdquo; answered Gwen, with blue-gray eyes open wide.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; said The Pilot, &ldquo;it was very mean to stand by and see you hurt like
      that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, you silly,&rdquo; replied Owen, impatiently, &ldquo;they want my back to get
      straight and strong.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, then they didn't do it just for fun or for nothing?&rdquo; said The Pilot,
      innocently.
    </p>
    <p>
      Gwen gazed at him in amazed and speechless wrath, and he went on:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I mean they love you though they let you be hurt; or rather they let the
      doctors hurt you BECAUSE they loved you and wanted to make you better.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Gwen kept her eyes fixed with curious earnestness upon his face till the
      light began to dawn.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you mean,&rdquo; she began slowly, &ldquo;that though God let me fall, He loves
      me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Pilot nodded; he could not trust his voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wonder if that can be true,&rdquo; she said, as if to herself; and soon we
      said good-by and came away&mdash;The Pilot, limp and voiceless, but I
      triumphant, for I began to see a little light for Gwen.
    </p>
    <p>
      But the fight was by no means over; indeed, it was hardly well begun. For
      when the autumn came, with its misty, purple days, most glorious of all
      days in the cattle country, the old restlessness came back and the fierce
      refusal of her lot. Then came the day of the round-up. Why should she have
      to stay while all went after the cattle? The Duke would have remained, but
      she impatiently sent him away. She was weary and heart-sick, and, worst of
      all, she began to feel that most terrible of burdens, the burden of her
      life to others. I was much relieved when The Pilot came in fresh and
      bright, waving a bunch of wild-flowers in his hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I thought they were all gone,&rdquo; he cried. &ldquo;Where do you think I found
      them? Right down by the big elm root,&rdquo; and, though he saw by the settled
      gloom of her face that the storm was coming, he went bravely on picturing
      the canyon in all the splendor of its autumn dress. But the spell would
      not work. Her heart was out on the sloping hills, where the cattle were
      bunching and crowding with tossing heads and rattling horns, and it was in
      a voice very bitter and impatient that she cried:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I am sick of all this! I want to ride! I want to see the cattle and
      the men and&mdash;and&mdash;and all the things outside.&rdquo; The Pilot was
      cowboy enough to know the longing that tugged at her heart for one wild
      race after the calves or steers, but he could only say:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wait, Gwen. Try to be patient.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am patient; at least I have been patient for two whole months, and it's
      no use, and I don't believe God cares one bit!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, He does, Gwen, more than any of us,&rdquo; replied The Pilot, earnestly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, He does not care,&rdquo; she answered, with angry emphasis, and The Pilot
      made no reply.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perhaps,&rdquo; she went on, hesitatingly, &ldquo;He's angry because I said I didn't
      care for Him, you remember? That was very wicked. But don't you think I'm
      punished nearly enough now? You made me very angry, and I didn't really
      mean it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Poor Gwen! God had grown to be very real to her during these weeks of
      pain, and very terrible. The Pilot looked down a moment into the blue-gray
      eyes, grown so big and so pitiful, and hurriedly dropping on his knees
      beside the bed he said, in a very unsteady voice:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, Gwen, Gwen, He's not like that. Don't you remember how Jesus was with
      the poor sick people? That's what He's like.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Could Jesus make me well?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, Gwen.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then why doesn't He?&rdquo; she asked; and there was no impatience now, but
      only trembling anxiety as she went on in a timid voice: &ldquo;I asked Him to,
      over and over, and said I would wait two months, and now it's more than
      three. Are you quite sure He hears now?&rdquo; She raised herself on her elbow
      and gazed searchingly into The Pilot's face. I was glad it was not into
      mine. As she uttered the words, &ldquo;Are you quite sure?&rdquo; one felt that things
      were in the balance. I could not help looking at The Pilot with intense
      anxiety. What would he answer? The Pilot gazed out of the window upon the
      hills for a few moments. How long the silence seemed! Then, turning,
      looked into the eyes that searched his so steadily and answered simply:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, Gwen, I am quite sure!&rdquo; Then, with quick inspiration, he got her
      mother's Bible and said: &ldquo;Now, Gwen, try to see it as I read.&rdquo; But, before
      he read, with the true artist's instinct he created the proper atmosphere.
      By a few vivid words he made us feel the pathetic loneliness of the Man of
      Sorrows in His last sad days. Then he read that masterpiece of all tragic
      picturing, the story of Gethsemane. And as he read we saw it all. The
      garden and the trees and the sorrow-stricken Man alone with His mysterious
      agony. We heard the prayer so pathetically submissive and then, for
      answer, the rabble and the traitor.
    </p>
    <p>
      Gwen was far too quick to need explanation, and The Pilot only said, &ldquo;You
      see, Gwen, God gave nothing but the best&mdash;to His own Son only the
      best.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The best? They took Him away, didn't they?&rdquo; She knew the story well.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, but listen.&rdquo; He turned the leaves rapidly and read: &ldquo;'We see Jesus
      for the suffering of death crowned with glory and honor.' That is how He
      got His Kingdom.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Gwen listened silent but unconvinced, and then said slowly:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But how can this be best for me? I am no use to anyone. It can't be best
      to just lie here and make them all wait on me, and&mdash;and&mdash;I did
      want to help daddy&mdash;and&mdash;oh&mdash;I know they will get tired of
      me! They are getting tired already&mdash;I&mdash;I&mdash;can't help being
      hateful.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She was by this time sobbing as I had never heard her before&mdash;deep,
      passionate sobs. Then again the Pilot had an inspiration.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now, Gwen,&rdquo; he said severely, &ldquo;you know we're not as mean as that, and
      that you are just talking nonsense, every word. Now I'm going to smooth
      out your red hair and tell you a story.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's NOT red,&rdquo; she cried, between her sobs. This was her sore point.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is red, as red can be; a beautiful, shining purple RED,&rdquo; said The
      Pilot emphatically, beginning to brush.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Purple!&rdquo; cried Gwen, scornfully.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I've seen it in the sun, purple. Haven't you?&rdquo; said The Pilot,
      appealing to me. &ldquo;And my story is about the canyon, our canyon, your
      canyon, down there.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is it true?&rdquo; asked Gwen, already soothed by the cool, quick-moving hands.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;True? It's as true as&mdash;as&mdash;&rdquo; he glanced round the room, &ldquo;as the
      Pilgrim's Progress.&rdquo; This was satisfactory, and the story went on.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;At first there were no canyons, but only the broad, open prairie. One day
      the Master of the Prairie, walking out over his great lawns, where were
      only grasses, asked the Prairie, 'Where are your flowers?' and the Prairie
      said, 'Master, I have no seeds.' Then he spoke to the birds, and they
      carried seeds of every kind of flower and strewed them far and wide, and
      soon the Prairie bloomed with crocuses and roses and buffalo beans and the
      yellow crowfoot and the wild sunflowers and the red lilies all the summer
      long. Then the Master came and was well pleased; but he missed the flowers
      he loved best of all, and he said to the Prairie: 'Where are the clematis
      and the columbine, the sweet violets and wind flowers, and all the ferns
      and flowering shrubs?' And again he spoke to the birds, and again they
      carried all the seeds and strewed them far and wide. But, again, when the
      Master came, he could not find the flowers he loved best of all, and he
      said: 'Where are those, my sweetest flowers?' and the Prairie cried
      sorrowfully: 'Oh, Master, I cannot keep the flowers, for the winds sweep
      fiercely, and the sun beats upon my breast, and they wither up and fly
      away.' Then the Master spoke to the Lightning, and with one swift blow the
      Lightning cleft the Prairie to the heart. And the Prairie rocked and
      groaned in agony, and for many a day moaned bitterly over its black,
      jagged, gaping wound. But the Little Swan poured its waters through the
      cleft, and carried down deep black mould, and once more the birds carried
      seeds and strewed them in the canyon. And after a long time the rough
      rocks were decked out with soft mosses and trailing vines, and all the
      nooks were hung with clematis and columbine, and great elms lifted their
      huge tops high up into the sunlight, and down about their feet clustered
      the low cedars and balsams, and everywhere the violets and wind-flower and
      maiden-hair grew and bloomed, till the canyon became the Masters place for
      rest and peace and joy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The quaint tale was ended, and Gwen lay quiet for some moments, then said
      gently:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes! The canyon flowers are much the best. Tell me what it means.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then The Pilot read to her: &ldquo;The fruits&mdash;I'll read 'flowers'&mdash;of
      the Spirit are love, joy, peace, long-suffering, gentleness, goodness,
      faith, meekness, self-control, and some of these grow only in the canyon.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Which are the canyon flowers?&rdquo; asked Gwen softly, and The Pilot answered:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Gentleness, meekness, self-control; but though the others, love, joy,
      peace, bloom in the open, yet never with so rich a bloom and so sweet a
      perfume as in the canyon.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      For a long time Gwen lay quite still, and then said wistfully, while her
      lip trembled:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There are no flowers in my canyon, but only ragged rocks.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Some day they will bloom, Gwen dear; He will find them, and we, too,
      shall see them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then he said good-by and took me away. He had done his work that day.
    </p>
    <p>
      We rode through the big gate, down the sloping hill, past the smiling,
      twinkling little lake, and down again out of the broad sunshine into the
      shadows and soft lights of the canyon. As we followed the trail that wound
      among the elms and cedars, the very air was full of gentle stillness; and
      as we moved we seemed to feel the touch of loving hands that lingered
      while they left us, and every flower and tree and vine and shrub and the
      soft mosses and the deep-bedded ferns whispered, as we passed, of love and
      peace and joy.
    </p>
    <p>
      To The Duke it was all a wonder, for as the days shortened outside they
      brightened inside; and every day, and more and more Gwen's room became the
      brightest spot in all the house, and when he asked The Pilot:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What did you do to the Little Princess, and what's all this about the
      canyon and its flowers?&rdquo; The Pilot said, looking wistfully into The Duke's
      eyes:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The fruits of the Spirit are love, peace, long-suffering, gentleness,
      goodness, faith, meekness, self-control, and some of these are found only
      in the canyon,&rdquo; and The Duke, standing up straight, handsome and strong,
      looked back at The Pilot and said, putting out his hand:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you know, I believe you're right.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I'm quite sure,&rdquo; answered The Pilot, simply. Then, holding The
      Duke's hand as long as one man dare hold another's, he added: &ldquo;When you
      come to your canyon, remember.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When I come!&rdquo; said The Duke, and a quick spasm of pain passed over his
      handsome face&mdash;&ldquo;God help me, it's not too far away now.&rdquo; Then he
      smiled again his old, sweet smile, and said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, you are all right, for, of all flowers I have seen, none are fairer
      or sweeter than those that are waving in Gwen's Canyon.&rdquo;
     </p>

      CHAPTER XIV
    </h2>
    <h3>
      BILL'S BLUFF
    </h3>
    <p>
      The Pilot had set his heart upon the building of a church in the Swan
      Creek district, partly because he was human and wished to set a mark of
      remembrance upon the country, but more because he held the sensible
      opinion, that a congregation, as a man, must have a home if it is to stay.
    </p>
    <p>
      All through the summer he kept setting this as an object at once desirable
      and possible to achieve. But few were found to agree with him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Little Mrs. Muir was of the few, and she was not to be despised, but her
      influence was neutralized by the solid immobility of her husband. He had
      never done anything sudden in his life. Every resolve was the result of a
      long process of mind, and every act of importance had to be previewed from
      all possible points. An honest man, strongly religious, and a great
      admirer of The Pilot, but slow-moving as a glacier, although with plenty
      of fire in him deep down.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He's soond at the hairt, ma man Robbie,&rdquo; his wife said to The Pilot, who
      was fuming and fretting at the blocking of his plans, &ldquo;but he's terrible
      deleeberate. Bide ye a bit, laddie. He'll come tae.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But meantime the summer's going and nothing will be done,&rdquo; was The
      Pilot's distressed and impatient answer.
    </p>
    <p>
      So a meeting was called to discuss the question of building a church, with
      the result that the five men and three women present decided that for the
      present nothing could be done. This was really Robbie's opinion, though he
      refused to do or say anything but grunt, as The Pilot said to me
      afterwards, in a rage. It is true, Williams, the storekeeper just come
      from &ldquo;across the line,&rdquo; did all the talking, but no one paid much
      attention to his fluent fatuities except as they represented the
      unexpressed mind of the dour, exasperating little Scotchman, who sat
      silent but for an &ldquo;ay&rdquo; now and then, so expressive and conclusive that
      everyone knew what he meant, and that discussion was at an end. The
      schoolhouse was quite sufficient for the present; the people were too few
      and too poor and they were getting on well under the leadership of their
      present minister. These were the arguments which Robbie's &ldquo;ay&rdquo; stamped as
      quite unanswerable.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was a sore blow to The Pilot, who had set his heart upon a church, and
      neither Mrs. Muir's &ldquo;hoots&rdquo; at her husband's slowness nor her promises
      that she &ldquo;wad mak him hear it&rdquo; could bring comfort or relieve his gloom.
    </p>
    <p>
      In this state of mind he rode up with me to pay our weekly visit to the
      little girl shut up in her lonely house among the hills.
    </p>
    <p>
      It had become The Pilot's custom during these weeks to turn for cheer to
      that little room, and seldom was he disappointed. She was so bright, so
      brave, so cheery, and so full of fun, that gloom faded from her presence
      as mist before the sun, and impatience was shamed into content.
    </p>
    <p>
      Gwen's bright face&mdash;it was almost always bright now&mdash;and her
      bright welcome did something for The Pilot, but the feeling of failure was
      upon him, and failure to his enthusiastic nature was worse than pain. Not
      that he confessed either to failure or gloom; he was far too true a man
      for that; but Gwen felt his depression in spite of all his brave attempts
      at brightness, and insisted that he was ill, appealing to me.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, it's only his church,&rdquo; I said, proceeding to give her an account of
      Robbie Muir's silent, solid inertness, and how he had blocked The Pilot's
      scheme.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What a shame!&rdquo; cried Gwen, indignantly. &ldquo;What a bad man he must be!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Pilot smiled. &ldquo;No, indeed,&rdquo; he answered; &ldquo;why, he's the best man in
      the place, but I wish he would say or do something. If he would only get
      mad and swear I think I should feel happier.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Gwen looked quite mystified.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You see, he sits there in solemn silence looking so tremendously wise
      that most men feel foolish if they speak, while as for doing anything the
      idea appears preposterous, in the face of his immovableness.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I can't bear him!&rdquo; cried Gwen. &ldquo;I should like to stick pins in him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wish some one would,&rdquo; answered The Pilot. &ldquo;It would make him seem more
      human if he could be made to jump.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Try again,&rdquo; said Gwen, &ldquo;and get someone to make him jump.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It would be easier to build the church,&rdquo; said The Pilot, gloomily.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I could make him jump,&rdquo; said Gwen, viciously, &ldquo;and I WILL,&rdquo; she added,
      after a pause.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You!&rdquo; answered The Pilot, opening his eyes. &ldquo;How?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'll find some way,&rdquo; she replied, resolutely.
    </p>
    <p>
      And so she did, for when the next meeting was called to consult as to the
      building of a church, the congregation, chiefly of farmers and their
      wives, with Williams, the storekeeper, were greatly surprised to see
      Bronco Bill, Hi, and half a dozen ranchers and cowboys walk in at
      intervals and solemnly seat themselves. Robbie looked at them with
      surprise and a little suspicion. In church matters he had no dealings with
      the Samaritans from the hills, and while, in their unregenerate condition,
      they might be regarded as suitable objects of missionary effort, as to
      their having any part in the direction, much less control, of the church
      policy&mdash;from such a notion Robbie was delivered by his loyal
      adherence to the scriptural injunction that he should not cast pearls
      before swine.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Pilot, though surprised to see Bill and the cattle men, was none the
      less delighted, and faced the meeting with more confidence. He stated the
      question for discussion: Should a church building be erected this summer
      in Swan Creek? and he put his case well. He showed the need of a church
      for the sake of the congregation, for the sake of the men in the district,
      the families growing up, the incoming settlers, and for the sake of the
      country and its future. He called upon all who loved their church and
      their country to unite in this effort. It was an enthusiastic appeal and
      all the women and some of the men were at once upon his side.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then followed dead, solemn silence. Robbie was content to wait till the
      effect of the speech should be dissipated in smaller talk. Then he gravely
      said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The kirk wad be a gran' thing, nae doot, an' they wad a' dootless&rdquo;&mdash;with
      a suspicious glance toward Bill&mdash;&ldquo;rejoice in its erection. But we
      maun be cautious, an' I wad like to enquire hoo much money a kirk cud be
      built for, and whaur the money wad come frae?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Pilot was ready with his answer. The cost would be $1,200. The Church
      Building Fund would contribute $200, the people could give $300 in labor,
      and the remaining $700 he thought could be raised in the district in two
      years' time.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ay,&rdquo; said Robbie, and the tone and manner were sufficient to drench any
      enthusiasm with the chilliest of water. So much was this the case that the
      chairman, Williams, seemed quite justified in saying:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is quite evident that the opinion of the meeting is adverse to any
      attempt to load the community with a debt of one thousand dollars,&rdquo; and he
      proceeded with a very complete statement of the many and various
      objections to any attempt at building a church this year. The people were
      very few, they were dispersed over a large area, they were not interested
      sufficiently, they were all spending money and making little in return; he
      supposed, therefore, that the meeting might adjourn.
    </p>
    <p>
      Robbie sat silent and expressionless in spite of his little wife's anxious
      whispers and nudges. The Pilot looked the picture of woe, and was on the
      point of bursting forth, when the meeting was startled by Bill.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Say, boys! they hain't much stuck on their shop, heh?&rdquo; The low, drawling
      voice was perfectly distinct and arresting.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hain't got no use for it, seemingly,&rdquo; was the answer from the dark
      corner.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Old Scotchie takes his religion out in prayin', I guess,&rdquo; drawled in
      Bill, &ldquo;but wants to sponge for his plant.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This reference to Robbie's proposal to use the school moved the youngsters
      to tittering and made the little Scotchman squirm, for he prided himself
      upon his independence.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There ain't $700 in the hull blanked outfit.&rdquo; This was a stranger's
      voice, and again Robbie squirmed, for he rather prided himself also on his
      ability to pay his way.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No good!&rdquo; said another emphatic voice. &ldquo;A blanked lot o' psalm-singing
      snipes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Order, order!&rdquo; cried the chairman.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Old Windbag there don't see any show for swipin' the collection, with
      Scotchie round,&rdquo; said Hi, with a following ripple of quiet laughter, for
      Williams' reputation was none too secure.
    </p>
    <p>
      Robbie was in a most uncomfortable state of mind. So unusually stirred was
      he that for the first time in his history he made a motion.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I move we adjourn, Mr. Chairman,&rdquo; he said, in a voice which actually
      vibrated with emotion.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Different here! eh, boys?&rdquo; drawled Bill.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You bet,&rdquo; said Hi, in huge delight. &ldquo;The meetin' ain't out yit.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ye can bide till mor-r-nin',&rdquo; said Robbie, angrily. &ldquo;A'm gaen hame,&rdquo;
       beginning to put on his coat.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Seems as if he orter give the password,&rdquo; drawled Bill.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Right you are, pardner,&rdquo; said Hi, springing to the door and waiting in
      delighted expectation for his friend's lead.
    </p>
    <p>
      Robbie looked at the door, then at his wife, hesitated a moment, I have no
      doubt wishing her home. Then Bill stood up and began to speak.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Chairman, I hain't been called on for any remarks&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Go on!&rdquo; yelled his friends from the dark corner. &ldquo;Hear! hear!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;An' I didn't feel as if this war hardly my game, though The Pilot ain't
      mean about invitin' a feller on Sunday afternoons. But them as runs the
      shop don't seem to want us fellers round too much.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Robbie was gazing keenly at Bill, and here shook his head, muttering
      angrily: &ldquo;Hoots, nonsense! ye're welcome eneuch.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But,&rdquo; went on Bill, slowly, &ldquo;I guess I've been on the wrong track. I've
      been a-cherishin' the opinion&rdquo; [&ldquo;Hear! hear!&rdquo; yelled his admirers],
      &ldquo;cherishin' the opinion,&rdquo; repeated Bill, &ldquo;that these fellers,&rdquo; pointing to
      Robbie, &ldquo;was stuck on religion, which I ain't much myself, and reely
      consarned about the blocking ov the devil, which The Pilot says can't be
      did without a regular Gospel factory. O' course, it tain't any biznis ov
      mine, but if us fellers was reely only sot on anything condoocin',&rdquo;
       [&ldquo;Hear! hear!&rdquo; yelled Hi, in ecstasy], &ldquo;condoocin',&rdquo; repeated Bill slowly
      and with relish, &ldquo;to the good ov the Order&rdquo; (Bill was a brotherhood man),
      &ldquo;I b'lieve I know whar five hundred dollars mebbe cud per'aps be got.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You bet your sox,&rdquo; yelled the strange voice, in chorus with other shouts
      of approval.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;O' course, I ain't no bettin' man,&rdquo; went on Bill, insinuatingly, &ldquo;as a
      regular thing, but I'd gamble a few jist here on this pint; if the boys
      was stuck on anythin' costin' about seven hundred dollars, it seems to me
      likely they'd git it in about two days, per'aps.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Here Robbie grunted out an &ldquo;ay&rdquo; of such fulness of contemptuous unbelief
      that Bill paused, and, looking over Robbie's head, he drawled out, even
      more slowly and mildly:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I ain't much given to bettin', as I remarked before, but, if a man shakes
      money at me on that proposition, I'd accommodate him to a limited extent.&rdquo;
       [&ldquo;Hear! hear! Bully boy!&rdquo; yelled Hi again, from the door.] &ldquo;Not bein' too
      bold, I cherish the opinion&rdquo; [again yells of approval from the corner],
      &ldquo;that even for this here Gospel plant, seein' The Pilot's rather sot onto
      it, I b'lieve the boys could find five hundred dollars inside ov a month,
      if perhaps these fellers cud wiggle the rest out ov their pants.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then Robbie was in great wrath and, stung by the taunting, drawling voice
      beyond all self-command, he broke out suddenly:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ye'll no can mak that guid, I doot.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;D'ye mean I ain't prepared to back it up?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ay,&rdquo; said Robbie, grimly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'Tain't likely I'll be called on; I guess $500 is safe enough,&rdquo; drawled
      Bill, cunningly drawing him on. Then Robbie bit.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oo ay!&rdquo; said he, in a voice of quiet contempt, &ldquo;the twa hunner wull be
      here and 'twull wait ye long eneuch, I'se warrant ye.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then Bill nailed him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I hain't got my card case on my person,&rdquo; he said, with a slight grin.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Left it on the pianner,&rdquo; suggested Hi, who was in a state of great
      hilarity at Bill's success in drawing the Scottie.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But,&rdquo; Bill proceeded, recovering himself, and with increasing suavity,
      &ldquo;if some gentleman would mark down the date of the almanac I cherish the
      opinion&rdquo; [cheers from the corner] &ldquo;that in one month from to-day there
      will be five hundred dollars lookin' round for two hundred on that there
      desk mebbe, or p'raps you would incline to two fifty,&rdquo; he drawled, in his
      most winning tone to Robbie, who was growing more impatient every moment.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nae matter tae me. Ye're haverin' like a daft loon, ony way.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You will make a memento of this slight transaction, boys, and per'aps the
      schoolmaster will write it down,&rdquo; said Bill.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was all carefully taken down, and amid much enthusiastic confusion the
      ranchers and their gang carried Bill off to Old Latour's to &ldquo;licker up,&rdquo;
       while Robbie, in deep wrath but in dour silence, went off through the dark
      with his little wife following some paces behind him. His chief grievance,
      however, was against the chairman for &ldquo;allooin' sic a disorderly pack o'
      loons tae disturb respectable fowk,&rdquo; for he could not hide the fact that
      he had been made to break through his accustomed defence line of immovable
      silence. I suggested, conversing with him next day upon the matter, that
      Bill was probably only chaffing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ay,&rdquo; said Robbie, in great disgust, &ldquo;the daft eejut, he wad mak a fule o'
      onything or onybuddie.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      That was the sorest point with poor Robbie. Bill had not only cast doubts
      upon his religious sincerity, which the little man could not endure, but
      he had also held him up to the ridicule of the community, which was
      painful to his pride. But when he understood, some days later, that Bill
      was taking steps to back up his offer and had been heard to declare that
      &ldquo;he'd make them pious ducks take water if he had to put up a year's pay,&rdquo;
       Robbie went quietly to work to make good his part of the bargain. For his
      Scotch pride would not suffer him to refuse a challenge from such a
      quarter.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XV
    </h2>
    <h3>
      BILL'S PARTNER
    </h3>
    <p>
      The next day everyone was talking of Bill's bluffing the church people,
      and there was much quiet chuckling over the discomfiture of Robbie Muir
      and his party.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Pilot was equally distressed and bewildered, for Bill's conduct, so
      very unusual, had only one explanation&mdash;the usual one for any folly
      in that country.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wish he had waited till after the meeting to go to Latour's. He spoiled
      the last chance I had. There's no use now,&rdquo; he said, sadly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But he may do something,&rdquo; I suggested.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, fiddle!&rdquo; said The Pilot, contemptuously. &ldquo;He was only giving Muir 'a
      song and dance,' as he would say. The whole thing is off.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But when I told Gwen the story of the night's proceedings, she went into
      raptures over Bill's grave speech and his success in drawing the canny
      Scotchman.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, lovely! dear old Bill and his 'cherished opinion.' Isn't he just
      lovely? Now he'll do something.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who, Bill?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, that stupid Scottie.&rdquo; This was her name for the immovable Robbie.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not he, I'm afraid. Of course Bill was just bluffing him. But it was good
      sport.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, lovely! I knew he'd do something.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who? Scottie?&rdquo; I asked, for her pronouns were perplexing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No!&rdquo; she cried, &ldquo;Bill! He promised he would, you know,&rdquo; she added.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So you were at the bottom of it?&rdquo; I said, amazed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, dear! Oh, dear!&rdquo; she kept crying, shrieking with laughter over Bill's
      cherishing opinions and desires. &ldquo;I shall be ill. Dear old Bill. He said
      he'd 'try to get a move on to him.'&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Before I left that day, Bill himself came to the Old Timer's ranch,
      inquiring in a casual way &ldquo;if the 'boss' was in.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, Bill!&rdquo; called out Gwen, &ldquo;come in here at once; I want you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      After some delay and some shuffling with hat and spurs, Bill lounged in
      and set his lank form upon the extreme end of a bench at the door, trying
      to look unconcerned as he remarked: &ldquo;Gittin' cold. Shouldn't wonder if
      we'd have a little snow.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, come here,&rdquo; cried Gwen, impatiently, holding out her hand. &ldquo;Come here
      and shake hands.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Bill hesitated, spat out into the other room his quid of tobacco, and
      swayed awkwardly across the room toward the bed, and, taking Gwen's hand,
      he shook it up and down, and hurriedly said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Fine day, ma'am; hope I see you quite well.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No; you don't,&rdquo; cried Gwen, laughing immoderately, but keeping hold of
      Bill's hand, to his great confusion. &ldquo;I'm not well a bit, but I'm a great
      deal better since hearing of your meeting, Bill.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      To this Bill made no reply, being entirely engrossed in getting his hard,
      bony, brown hand out of the grasp of the white, clinging fingers.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, Bill,&rdquo; went on Gwen, &ldquo;it was delightful! How did you do it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But Bill, who had by this time got back to his seat at the door, pretended
      ignorance of any achievement calling for remark. He &ldquo;hadn't done nothin'
      more out ov the way than usual.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, don't talk nonsense!&rdquo; cried Gwen, impatiently. &ldquo;Tell me how you got
      Scottie to lay you two hundred and fifty dollars.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, that!&rdquo; said Bill, in great surprise; &ldquo;that ain't nuthin' much.
      Scottie riz slick enough.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But how did you get him?&rdquo; persisted Gwen. &ldquo;Tell me, Bill,&rdquo; she added, in
      her most coaxing voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said Bill, &ldquo;it was easy as rollin' off a log. I made the remark as
      how the boys ginerally put up for what they wanted without no fuss, and
      that if they was sot on havin' a Gospel shack I cherished the opinion&rdquo;&mdash;here
      Gwen went off into a smothered shriek, which made Bill pause and look at
      her in alarm.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Go on,&rdquo; she gasped.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I cherished the opinion,&rdquo; drawled on Bill, while Gwen stuck her
      handkerchief into her mouth, &ldquo;that mebbe they'd put up for it the seven
      hundred dollars, and, even as it was, seein' as The Pilot appeared to be
      sot on to it, if them fellers would find two hundred and fifty I cher&mdash;&rdquo;
       another shriek from Gwen cut him suddenly short.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's the rheumaticks, mebbe,&rdquo; said Bill, anxiously. &ldquo;Terrible bad weather
      for 'em. I get 'em myself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, no,&rdquo; said Gwen, wiping away her tears and subduing her laughter. &ldquo;Go
      on, Bill.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There ain't no more,&rdquo; said Bill. &ldquo;He bit, and the master here put it
      down.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, it's here right enough,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;but I don't suppose you mean to
      follow it up, do you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You don't, eh? Well, I am not responsible for your supposin', but them
      that is familiar with Bronco Bill generally expects him to back up his
      undertakin's.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But how in the world can you get five hundred dollars from the cowboys
      for a church?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I hain't done the arithmetic yet, but it's safe enough. You see, it ain't
      the church altogether, it's the reputation of the boys.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'll help, Bill,&rdquo; said Gwen.
    </p>
    <p>
      Bill nodded his head slowly and said: &ldquo;Proud to have you,&rdquo; trying hard to
      look enthusiastic.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You don't think I can,&rdquo; said Gwen. Bill protested against such an
      imputation. &ldquo;But I can. I'll get daddy and The Duke, too.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good line!&rdquo; said Bill, slapping his knee.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And I'll give all my money, too, but it isn't very much,&rdquo; she added,
      sadly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Much!&rdquo; said Bill, &ldquo;if the rest of the fellows play up to that lead there
      won't be any trouble about that five hundred.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Gwen was silent for some time, then said with an air of resolve:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'll give my pinto!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nonsense!&rdquo; I exclaimed, while Bill declared &ldquo;there warn't no call.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes. I'll give the Pinto!&rdquo; said Gwen, decidedly. &ldquo;I'll not need him any
      more,&rdquo; her lips quivered, and Bill coughed and spat into the next room,
      &ldquo;and besides, I want to give something I like. And Bill will sell him for
      me!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said Bill, slowly, &ldquo;now come to think, it'll be purty hard to sell
      that there pinto.&rdquo; Gwen began to exclaim indignantly, and Bill hurried on
      to say, &ldquo;Not but what he ain't a good leetle horse for his weight, good
      leetle horse, but for cattle&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, Bill, there isn't a better cattle horse anywhere!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, that's so,&rdquo; assented Bill. &ldquo;That's so, if you've got the rider, but
      put one of them rangers on to him and it wouldn't be no fair show.&rdquo; Bill
      was growing more convinced every moment that the pinto wouldn't sell to
      any advantage. &ldquo;Ye see,&rdquo; he explained carefully and cunningly, &ldquo;he ain't a
      horse you could yank round and slam into a bunch of steers regardless.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Gwen shuddered. &ldquo;Oh, I wouldn't think of selling him to any of those
      cowboys.&rdquo; Bill crossed his legs and hitched round uncomfortably on his
      bench. &ldquo;I mean one of those rough fellows that don't know how to treat a
      horse.&rdquo; Bill nodded, looking relieved. &ldquo;I thought that some one like you,
      Bill, who knew how to handle a horse&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Gwen paused, and then added: &ldquo;I'll ask The Duke.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No call for that,&rdquo; said Bill, hastily, &ldquo;not but what The Dook ain't all
      right as a jedge of a horse, but The Dook ain't got the connection, it
      ain't his line.&rdquo; Bill hesitated. &ldquo;But, if you are real sot on to sellin'
      that pinto, come to think I guess I could find a sale for him, though, of
      course, I think perhaps the figger won't be high.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And so it was arranged that the pinto should be sold and that Bill should
      have the selling of it.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was characteristic of Gwen that she would not take farewell of the pony
      on whose back she had spent so many hours of freedom and delight. When
      once she gave him up she refused to allow her heart to cling to him any
      more.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was characteristic, too, of Bill that he led off the pinto after night
      had fallen, so that &ldquo;his pardner&rdquo; might be saved the pain of the parting.
    </p>

      CHAPTER XVI
    </h2>
    <h3>
      BILL'S FINANCING
    </h3>
    <p>
      Bill's method of conducting the sale of the pinto was eminently successful
      as a financial operation, but there are those in the Swan Creek country
      who have never been able to fathom the mystery attaching to the affair. It
      was at the fall round-up, the beef round-up, as it is called, which this
      year ended at the Ashley Ranch. There were representatives from all the
      ranches and some cattle-men from across the line. The hospitality of the
      Ashley Ranch was up to its own lofty standard, and, after supper, the men
      were in a state of high exhilaration. The Hon. Fred and his wife, Lady
      Charlotte, gave themselves to the duties of their position as hosts for
      the day with a heartiness and grace beyond praise. After supper the men
      gathered round the big fire, which was piled up before the long, low shed,
      which stood open in front. It was a scene of such wild and picturesque
      interest as can only be witnessed in the western ranching country. About
      the fire, most of them wearing &ldquo;shaps&rdquo; and all of them wide, hard-brimmed
      cowboy hats, the men grouped themselves, some reclining upon skins thrown
      upon the ground, some standing, some sitting, smoking, laughing, chatting,
      all in highest spirits and humor. They had just got through with their
      season of arduous and, at times, dangerous toil. Their minds were full of
      their long, hard rides, their wild and varying experiences with mad cattle
      and bucking broncos, their anxious watchings through hot nights, when a
      breath of wind or a coyote's howl might set the herd off in a frantic
      stampede, their wolf hunts and badger fights and all the marvellous
      adventures that fill up a cowboy's summer. Now these were all behind them.
      To-night they were free men and of independent means, for their season's
      pay was in their pockets. The day's excitement, too, was still in their
      blood, and they were ready for anything.
    </p>
    <p>
      Bill, as king of the bronco-busters, moved about with the slow, careless
      indifference of a man sure of his position and sure of his ability to
      maintain it.
    </p>
    <p>
      He spoke seldom and slowly, was not as ready-witted as his partner, Hi
      Kendal, but in act he was swift and sure, and &ldquo;in trouble&rdquo; he could be
      counted on. He was, as they said, &ldquo;a white man; white to the back,&rdquo; which
      was understood to sum up the true cattle man's virtues.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hello, Bill,&rdquo; said a friend, &ldquo;where's Hi? Hain't seen him around!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, don't jest know. He was going to bring up my pinto.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your pinto? What pinto's that? You hain't got no pinto!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mebbe not,&rdquo; said Bill, slowly, &ldquo;but I had the idee before you spoke that
      I had.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That so? Whar'd ye git him? Good for cattle?&rdquo; The crowd began to gather.
    </p>
    <p>
      Bill grew mysterious, and even more than usually reserved.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good fer cattle! Well, I ain't much on gamblin', but I've got a leetle in
      my pants that says that there pinto kin outwork any blanked bronco in this
      outfit, givin' him a fair show after the cattle.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The men became interested.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Whar was he raised?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dunno.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Whar'd ye git him? Across the line?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; said Bill stoutly, &ldquo;right in this here country. The Dook there knows
      him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This at once raised the pinto several points. To be known, and, as Bill's
      tone indicated, favorably known by The Duke, was a testimonial to which
      any horse might aspire.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Whar'd ye git him, Bill? Don't be so blanked oncommunicatin'!&rdquo; said an
      impatient voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      Bill hesitated; then, with an apparent burst of confidence, he assumed his
      frankest manner and voice, and told his tale.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; he said, taking a fresh chew and offering his plug to his
      neighbor, who passed it on after helping himself, &ldquo;ye see, it was like
      this. Ye know that little Meredith gel?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Chorus of answers: &ldquo;Yes! The red-headed one. I know! She's a daisy!&mdash;reg'lar
      blizzard!&mdash;lightnin' conductor!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Bill paused, stiffened himself a little, dropped his frank air and drawled
      out in cool, hard tones: &ldquo;I might remark that that young lady is, I might
      persoom to say, a friend of mine, which I'm prepared to back up in my best
      style, and if any blanked blanked son of a street sweeper has any remark
      to make, here's his time now!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      In the pause that followed murmurs were heard extolling the many
      excellences of the young lady in question, and Bill, appeased, yielded to
      the requests for the continuance of his story, and, as he described Gwen
      and her pinto and her work on the ranch, the men, many of whom had had
      glimpses of her, gave emphatic approval in their own way. But as he told
      of her rescue of Joe and of the sudden calamity that had befallen her a
      great stillness fell upon the simple, tender-hearted fellows, and they
      listened with their eyes shining in the firelight with growing intentness.
      Then Bill spoke of The Pilot and how he stood by her and helped her and
      cheered her till they began to swear he was &ldquo;all right&rdquo;; &ldquo;and now,&rdquo;
       concluded Bill, &ldquo;when The Pilot is in a hole she wants to help him out.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;O' course,&rdquo; said one. &ldquo;Right enough. How's she going to work it?&rdquo; said
      another.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, he's dead set on to buildin' a meetin'-house, and them fellows down
      at the Creek that does the prayin' and such don't seem to back him up!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Whar's the kick, Bill?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, they don't want to go down into their clothes and put up for it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How much?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, he only asked 'em for seven hundred the hull outfit, and would give
      'em two years, but they bucked&mdash;wouldn't look at it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      [Chorus of expletives descriptive of the characters and personal
      appearance and belongings of the congregation of Swan Creek.]
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Were you there, Bill? What did you do?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; said Bill, modestly, &ldquo;I didn't do much. Gave 'em a little bluff.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No! How? What? Go on, Bill.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But Bill remained silent, till under strong pressure, and, as if making a
      clean breast of everything, he said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I jest told 'em that if you boys made such a fuss about anythin'
      like they did about their Gospel outfit, an' I ain't sayin' anythin' agin
      it, you'd put up seven hundred without turnin' a hair.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You're the stuff, Bill! Good man! You're talkin' now! What did they say
      to that, eh, Bill?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said Bill, slowly, &ldquo;they CALLED me!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No! That so? An' what did you do, Bill?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Gave 'em a dead straight bluff!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      [Yells of enthusiastic approval.]
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did they take you, Bill?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I reckon they did. The master, here, put it down.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Whereupon I read the terms of Bill's bluff.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was a chorus of very hearty approvals of Bill's course in &ldquo;not
      taking any water&rdquo; from that variously characterized &ldquo;outfit.&rdquo; But the
      responsibility of the situation began to dawn upon them when some one
      asked:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How are you going about it, Bill?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; drawled Bill, with a touch of sarcasm in his voice, &ldquo;there's that
      pinto.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pinto be blanked!&rdquo; said young Hill. &ldquo;Say, boys, is that little girl going
      to lose that one pony of hers to help out her friend The Pilot? Good
      fellow, too, he is! We know he's the right sort.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      [Chorus of, &ldquo;Not by a long sight; not much; we'll put up the stuff!
      Pinto!&rdquo;]
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then,&rdquo; went on Bill, even more slowly, &ldquo;there's The Pilot; he's going for
      to ante up a month's pay; 'taint much, o' course&mdash;twenty-eight a
      month and grub himself. He might make it two,&rdquo; he added, thoughtfully. But
      Bill's proposal was scorned with contemptuous groans. &ldquo;Twenty-eight a
      month and grub himself o' course ain't much for a man to save money out ov
      to eddicate himself.&rdquo; Bill continued, as if thinking aloud, &ldquo;O' course
      he's got his mother at home, but she can't make much more than her own
      livin', but she might help him some.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This was altogether too much for the crowd. They consigned Bill and his
      plans to unutterable depths of woe.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;O' course,&rdquo; Bill explained, &ldquo;it's jest as you boys feel about it. Mebbe I
      was, bein' hot, a little swift in givin' 'em the bluff.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not much, you wasn't! We'll see you out! That's the talk! There's between
      twenty and thirty of us here.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I should be glad to contribute thirty or forty if need be,&rdquo; said The
      Duke, who was standing not far off, &ldquo;to assist in the building of a
      church. It would be a good thing, and I think the parson should be
      encouraged. He's the right sort.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'll cover your thirty,&rdquo; said young Hill; and so it went from one to
      another in tens and fifteens and twenties, till within half an hour I had
      entered three hundred and fifty dollars in my book, with Ashley yet to
      hear from, which meant fifty more. It was Bill's hour of triumph.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Boys,&rdquo; he said, with solemn emphasis, &ldquo;ye're all white. But that leetle
      pale-faced gel, that's what I'm thinkin' on. Won't she open them big eyes
      ov hers! I cherish the opinion that this'll tickle her some.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The men were greatly pleased with Bill and even more pleased with
      themselves. Bill's picture of the &ldquo;leetle gel&rdquo; and her pathetically tragic
      lot had gone right to their hearts and, with men of that stamp, it was one
      of their few luxuries to yield to their generous impulses. The most of
      them had few opportunities of lavishing love and sympathy upon worthy
      objects and, when the opportunity came, all that was best in them clamored
      for expression.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XVII
    </h2>
    <h3>
      HOW THE PINTO SOLD
    </h3>
    <p>
      The glow of virtuous feeling following the performance of their generous
      act prepared the men for a keener enjoyment than usual of a night's sport.
      They had just begun to dispose themselves in groups about the fire for
      poker and other games when Hi rode up into the light and with him a
      stranger on Gwen's beautiful pinto pony.
    </p>
    <p>
      Hi was evidently half drunk and, as he swung himself of his bronco, he
      saluted the company with a wave of the hand and hoped he saw them
      &ldquo;kickin'.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Bill, looking curiously at Hi, went up to the pinto and, taking him by the
      head, led him up into the light, saying:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;See here, boys, there's that pinto of mine I was telling you about; no
      flies on him, eh?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hold on there! Excuse me!&rdquo; said the stranger, &ldquo;this here hoss belongs to
      me, if paid-down money means anything in this country.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The country's all right,&rdquo; said Bill in an ominously quiet voice, &ldquo;but
      this here pinto's another transaction, I reckon.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The hoss is mine, I say, and what's more, I'm goin' to hold him,&rdquo; said
      the stranger in a loud voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      The men began to crowd around with faces growing hard. It was dangerous in
      that country to play fast and loose with horses.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Look a-hyar, mates,&rdquo; said the stranger, with a Yankee drawl, &ldquo;I ain't no
      hoss thief, and if I hain't bought this hoss reg'lar and paid down good
      money then it ain't mine&mdash;if I have it is. That's fair, ain't it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      At this Hi pulled himself together, and in a half-drunken tone declared
      that the stranger was all right, and that he had bought the horse fair and
      square, and &ldquo;there's your dust,&rdquo; said Hi, handing a roll to Bill. But with
      a quick movement Bill caught the stranger by the leg, and, before a word
      could be said, he was lying flat on the ground.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You git off that pony,&rdquo; said Bill, &ldquo;till this thing is settled.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There was something so terrible in Bill's manner that the man contented
      himself with blustering and swearing, while Bill, turning to Hi, said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did you sell this pinto to him?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Hi was able to acknowledge that, being offered a good price, and knowing
      that his partner was always ready for a deal, he had transferred the pinto
      to the stranger for forty dollars.
    </p>
    <p>
      Bill was in distress, deep and poignant. &ldquo;'Taint the horse, but the leetle
      gel,&rdquo; he explained; but his partner's bargain was his, and wrathful as he
      was, he refused to attempt to break the bargain.
    </p>
    <p>
      At this moment the Hon. Fred, noting the unusual excitement about the
      fire, came up, followed at a little distance by his wife and The Duke.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perhaps he'll sell,&rdquo; he suggested.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; said Bill sullenly, &ldquo;he's a mean cuss.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know him,&rdquo; said the Hon. Fred, &ldquo;let me try him.&rdquo; But the stranger
      declared the pinto suited him down to the ground and he wouldn't take
      twice his money for him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why,&rdquo; he protested, &ldquo;that there's what I call an unusual hoss, and down
      in Montana for a lady he'd fetch up to a hundred and fifty dollars.&rdquo; In
      vain they haggled and bargained; the man was immovable. Eighty dollars he
      wouldn't look at, a hundred hardly made him hesitate. At this point Lady
      Charlotte came down into the light and stood by her husband, who explained
      the circumstances to her. She had already heard Bill's description of
      Gwen's accident and of her part in the church-building schemes. There was
      silence for a few moments as she stood looking at the beautiful pony.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What a shame the poor child should have to part with the dear little
      creature!&rdquo; she said in a low tone to her husband. Then, turning to the
      stranger, she said in clear, sweet tones:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What do you ask for him?&rdquo; He hesitated and then said, lifting his hat
      awkwardly in salute: &ldquo;I was just remarking how that pinto would fetch one
      hundred and fifty dollars down into Montana. But seein' as a lady is
      enquirin', I'll put him down to one hundred and twenty-five.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Too much,&rdquo; she said promptly, &ldquo;far too much, is it not, Bill?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; drawled Bill, &ldquo;if 'twere a fellar as was used to ladies he'd offer
      you the pinto, but he's too pizen mean even to come down to the even
      hundred.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Yankee took him up quickly. &ldquo;Wall, if I were so blanked&mdash;pardon,
      madam&rdquo;&mdash;taking off his hat, &ldquo;used to ladies as some folks would like
      to think themselves, I'd buy that there pinto and make a present of it to
      this here lady as stands before me.&rdquo; Bill twisted uneasily.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But I ain't goin' to be mean; I'll put that pinto in for the even money
      for the lady if any man cares to put up the stuff.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, my dear,&rdquo; said the Hon. Fred with a bow, &ldquo;we cannot well let that
      gage lie.&rdquo; She turned and smiled at him and the pinto was transferred to
      the Ashley stables, to Bill's outspoken delight, who declared he &ldquo;couldn't
      have faced the music if that there pinto had gone across the line.&rdquo; I
      confess, however, I was somewhat surprised at the ease with which Hi
      escaped his wrath, and my surprise was in no way lessened when I saw,
      later in the evening, the two partners with the stranger taking a quiet
      drink out of the same bottle with evident mutual admiration and delight.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You're an A1 corker, you are! I'll be blanked if you ain't a bird&mdash;a
      singin' bird&mdash;a reg'lar canary,&rdquo; I heard Hi say to Bill.
    </p>
    <p>
      But Bill's only reply was a long, slow wink which passed into a frown as
      he caught my eye. My suspicion was aroused that the sale of the pinto
      might bear investigation, and this suspicion was deepened when Gwen next
      week gave me a rapturous account of how splendidly Bill had disposed of
      the pinto, showing me bills for one hundred and fifty dollars! To my look
      of amazement, Gwen replied:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You see, he must have got them bidding against each other, and besides,
      Bill says pintos are going up.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Light began to dawn upon me, but I only answered that I knew they had
      risen very considerably in value within a month. The extra fifty was
      Bill's.
    </p>
    <p>
      I was not present to witness the finishing of Bill's bluff, but was told
      that when Bill made his way through the crowded aisle and laid his five
      hundred and fifty dollars on the schoolhouse desk the look of disgust,
      surprise and finally of pleasure on Robbie's face, was worth a hundred
      more. But Robbie was ready and put down his two hundred with the single
      remark:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ay! ye're no as daft as ye look,&rdquo; mid roars of laughter from all.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then The Pilot, with eyes and face shining, rose and thanked them all; but
      when he told of how the little girl in her lonely shack in the hills
      thought so much of the church that she gave up for it her beloved pony,
      her one possession, the light from his eyes glowed in the eyes of all.
    </p>
    <p>
      But the men from the ranches who could understand the full meaning of her
      sacrifice and who also could realize the full measure of her calamity,
      were stirred to their hearts' depths, so that when Bill remarked in a very
      distinct undertone, &ldquo;I cherish the opinion that this here Gospel shop
      wouldn't be materializin' into its present shape but for that leetle gel,&rdquo;
       there rose growls of approval in a variety of tones and expletives that
      left no doubt that his opinion was that of all.
    </p>
    <p>
      But though The Pilot never could quite get at the true inwardness of
      Bill's measures and methods, and was doubtless all the more comfortable in
      mind for that, he had no doubt that while Gwen's influence was the moving
      spring of action, Bill's bluff had a good deal to do with the
      &ldquo;materializin'&rdquo; of the first church in Swan Creek, and in this conviction,
      I share.
    </p>
    <p>
      Whether the Hon. Fred ever understood the peculiar style of Bill's
      financing, I do not quite know. But if he ever did come to know, he was
      far too much of a man to make a fuss. Besides, I fancy the smile on his
      lady's face was worth some large amount to him. At least, so the look of
      proud and fond love in his eyes seemed to say as he turned away with her
      from the fire the night of the pinto's sale.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XVIII
    </h2>
    <h3>
      THE LADY CHARLOTTE
    </h3>
    <p>
      The night of the pinto's sale was a night momentous to Gwen, for then it
      was that the Lady Charlotte's interest in her began. Momentous, too, to
      the Lady Charlotte, for it was that night that brought The Pilot into her
      life.
    </p>
    <p>
      I had turned back to the fire around which the men had fallen into groups
      prepared to have an hour's solid delight, for the scene was full of wild
      and picturesque beauty to me, when The Duke came and touched me on the
      shoulder.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Lady Charlotte would like to see you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And why, pray?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She wants to hear about this affair of Bill's.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      We went through the kitchen into the large dining-room, at one end of
      which was a stone chimney and fireplace. Lady Charlotte had declared that
      she did not much care what kind of a house the Hon. Fred would build for
      her, but that she must have a fireplace.
    </p>
    <p>
      She was very beautiful&mdash;tall, slight and graceful in every line.
      There was a reserve and a grand air in her bearing that put people in awe
      of her. This awe I shared; but as I entered the room she welcomed me with
      such kindly grace that I felt quite at ease in a moment.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come and sit by me,&rdquo; she said, drawing an armchair into the circle about
      the fire. &ldquo;I want you to tell us all about a great many things.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You see what you're in for, Connor,&rdquo; said her husband. &ldquo;It is a serious
      business when my lady takes one in hand.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;As he knows to his cost,&rdquo; she said, smiling and shaking her head at her
      husband.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So I can testify,&rdquo; put in The Duke.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah! I can't do anything with you,&rdquo; she replied, turning to him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your most abject slave,&rdquo; he replied with a profound bow.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you only were,&rdquo; smiling at him&mdash;a little sadly, I thought&mdash;&ldquo;I'd
      keep you out of all sorts of mischief.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Quite true, Duke,&rdquo; said her husband, &ldquo;just look at me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Duke gazed at him a moment or two. &ldquo;Wonderful!&rdquo; he murmured, &ldquo;what a
      deliverance!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nonsense!&rdquo; broke in Lady Charlotte. &ldquo;You are turning my mind away from my
      purpose.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is it possible, do you think?&rdquo; said The Duke to her husband.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not in the very least,&rdquo; he replied, &ldquo;if my experience goes for anything.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But Lady Charlotte turned her back upon them and said to me:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now, tell me first about Bill's encounter with that funny little
      Scotchman.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then I told her the story of Bill's bluff in my best style, imitating, as
      I have some small skill in doing, the manner and speech of the various
      actors in the scene. She was greatly amused and interested.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And Bill has really got his share ready,&rdquo; she cried. &ldquo;It is very clever
      of him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; I replied, &ldquo;but Bill is only the very humble instrument, the moving
      spirit is behind.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, yes, you mean the little girl that owns the pony,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;That's
      another thing you must tell me about.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The Duke knows more than I,&rdquo; I replied, shifting the burden to him; &ldquo;my
      acquaintance is only of yesterday; his is lifelong.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why have you never told me of her?&rdquo; she demanded, turning to the Duke.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Haven't I told you of the little Meredith girl? Surely I have,&rdquo; said The
      Duke, hesitatingly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now, you know quite well you have not, and that means you are deeply
      interested. Oh, I know you well,&rdquo; she said, severely.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He is the most secretive man,&rdquo; she went on to me, &ldquo;shamefully and
      ungratefully reserved.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Duke smiled; then said, lazily: &ldquo;Why, she's just a child. Why should
      you be interested in her? No one was,&rdquo; he added sadly, &ldquo;till misfortune
      distinguished her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Her eyes grew soft, and her gay manner changed, and she said to The Duke
      gently: &ldquo;Tell me of her now.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It was evidently an effort, but he began his story of Gwen from the time
      he saw her first, years ago, playing in and out of her father's rambling
      shack, shy and wild as a young fox. As he went on with his tale, his voice
      dropped into a low, musical tone, and he seemed as if dreaming aloud.
      Unconsciously he put into the tale much of himself, revealing how great an
      influence the little child had had upon him, and how empty of love his
      life had been in this lonely land. Lady Charlotte listened with face
      intent upon him, and even her bluff husband was conscious that something
      more than usual was happening. He had never heard The Duke break through
      his proud reserve before.
    </p>
    <p>
      But when The Duke told the story of Gwen's awful fall, which he did with
      great graphic power, a little red spot burned upon the Lady Charlotte's
      pale cheek, and, as The Duke finished his tale with the words, &ldquo;It was her
      last ride,&rdquo; she covered her face with her hands and cried:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, Duke, it is horrible to think of! But what splendid courage!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Great stuff! eh, Duke?&rdquo; cried the Hon. Fred, kicking a burning log
      vigorously.
    </p>
    <p>
      But The Duke made no reply.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How is she now, Duke?&rdquo; said Lady Charlotte. The Duke looked up as from a
      dream. &ldquo;Bright as the morning,&rdquo; he said. Then, in reply to Lady
      Charlotte's look of wonder, he added:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The Pilot did it. Connor will tell you. I don't understand it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nor do I, either. But I can tell you only what I saw and heard,&rdquo; I
      answered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tell me,&rdquo; said Lady Charlotte very gently.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then I told her how, one by one, we had failed to help her, and how The
      Pilot had ridden up that morning through the canyon, and how he had
      brought the first light and peace to her by his marvellous pictures of the
      flowers and ferns and trees and all the wonderful mysteries of that
      wonderful canyon.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But that wasn't all,&rdquo; said the Duke quickly, as I stopped.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; I said slowly, &ldquo;that was NOT all by a long way; but the rest I don't
      understand. That's The Pilot's secret.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tell me what he did,&rdquo; said Lady Charlotte, softly, once more. &ldquo;I want to
      know.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't think I can,&rdquo; I replied. &ldquo;He simply read out of the Scriptures to
      her and talked.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Lady Charlotte looked disappointed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is that all?&rdquo; she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is quite enough for Gwen,&rdquo; said The Duke confidently, &ldquo;for there she
      lies, often suffering, always longing for the hills and the free air, but
      with her face radiant as the flowers of the beloved canyon.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I must see her,&rdquo; said Lady Charlotte, &ldquo;and that wonderful Pilot.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You'll be disappointed in him,&rdquo; said The Duke.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I've see him and heard him, but I don't know him,&rdquo; she replied.
      &ldquo;There must be something in him that one does not see at first.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So I have discovered,&rdquo; said The Duke, and with that the subject was
      dropped, but not before the Lady Charlotte made me promise to take her to
      Gwen, The Duke being strangely unwilling to do this for her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You'll be disappointed,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;She is only a simple little child.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But Lady Charlotte thought differently, and, having made up her mind upon
      the matter, there was nothing for it, as her husband said, but &ldquo;for all
      hands to surrender and the sooner the better.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And so the Lady Charlotte had her way, which, as it turned out, was much
      the wisest and best.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XIX
    </h2>
    <h3>
      THROUGH GWEN'S WINDOW
    </h3>
    <p>
      When I told The Pilot of Lady Charlotte's purpose to visit Gwen, he was
      not too well pleased.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What does she want with Gwen?&rdquo; he said impatiently. &ldquo;She will just put
      notions into her head and make the child discontented.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why should she?&rdquo; said I.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She won't mean to, but she belongs to another world, and Gwen cannot talk
      to her without getting glimpses of a life that will make her long for what
      she can never have,&rdquo; said The Pilot.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But suppose it is not idle curiosity in Lady Charlotte,&rdquo; I suggested.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't say it is quite that,&rdquo; he answered, &ldquo;but these people love a
      sensation.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't think you know Lady Charlotte,&rdquo; I replied. &ldquo;I hardly think from
      her tone the other night that she is a sensation hunter.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;At any rate,&rdquo; he answered, decidedly, &ldquo;she is not to worry poor Gwen.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I was a little surprised at his attitude, and felt that he was unfair to
      Lady Charlotte, but I forbore to argue with him on the matter. He could
      not bear to think of any person or thing threatening the peace of his
      beloved Gwen.
    </p>
    <p>
      The very first Saturday after my promise was given we were surprised to
      see Lady Charlotte ride up to the door of our shack in the early morning.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You see, I am not going to let you off,&rdquo; she said, as I greeted her. &ldquo;And
      the day is so very fine for a ride.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I hastened to apologize for not going to her, and then to get out of my
      difficulty, rather meanly turned toward The Pilot, and said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The Pilot doesn't approve of our visit.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And why not, may I ask?&rdquo; said Lady Charlotte, lifting her eyebrows.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Pilot's face burned, partly with wrath at me, and partly with
      embarrassment; for Lady Charlotte had put on her grand air. But he stood
      to his guns.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I was saying, Lady Charlotte,&rdquo; he said, looking straight into her eyes,
      &ldquo;that you and Gwen have little in common&mdash;and&mdash;and&mdash;&rdquo; he
      hesitated.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Little in common!&rdquo; said Lady Charlotte quietly. &ldquo;She has suffered
      greatly.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Pilot was quick to catch the note of sadness in her voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; he said, wondering at her tone, &ldquo;she has suffered greatly.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And,&rdquo; continued Lady Charlotte, &ldquo;she is bright as the morning, The Duke
      says.&rdquo; There was a look of pain in her face.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Pilot's face lit up, and he came nearer and laid his hand caressingly
      upon her beautiful horse.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, thank God!&rdquo; he said quickly, &ldquo;bright as the morning.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How can that be?&rdquo; she asked, looking down into his face. &ldquo;Perhaps she
      would tell me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Lady Charlotte,&rdquo; said The Pilot with a sudden flush, &ldquo;I must ask your
      pardon. I was wrong. I thought you&mdash;&rdquo; he paused; &ldquo;but go to Gwen, she
      will tell you, and you will do her good.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thank you,&rdquo; said Lady Charlotte, putting out her hand, &ldquo;and perhaps you
      will come and see me, too.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Pilot promised and stood looking after us as we rode up the trail.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There is something more in your Pilot than at first appears,&rdquo; she said.
      &ldquo;The Duke was quite right.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He is a great man,&rdquo; I said with enthusiasm; &ldquo;tender as a woman and with
      the heart of a hero.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You and Bill and The Duke seem to agree about him,&rdquo; she said, smiling.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then I told her tales of The Pilot, and of his ways with the men, till her
      blue eyes grew bright and her beautiful face lost its proud look.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is perfectly amazing,&rdquo; I said, finishing my story, &ldquo;how these
      devil-may-care rough fellows respect him, and come to him in all sorts of
      trouble. I can't understand it, and yet he is just a boy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, not amazing,&rdquo; said Lady Charlotte slowly. &ldquo;I think I understand it.
      He has a true man's heart; and holds a great purpose in it. I've seen men
      like that. Not clergymen, I mean, but men with a great purpose.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then, after a moment's thought, she added: &ldquo;But you ought to care for him
      better. He does not look strong.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Strong!&rdquo; I exclaimed quickly, with a queer feeling of resentment at my
      heart. &ldquo;He can do as much riding as any of us.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Still,&rdquo; she replied, &ldquo;there's something in his face that would make his
      mother anxious.&rdquo; In spite of my repudiation of her suggestion, I found
      myself for the next few minutes thinking of how he would come exhausted
      and faint from his long rides, and I resolved that he must have a rest and
      change.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was one of those early September days, the best of all in the western
      country, when the light falls less fiercely through a soft haze that seems
      to fill the air about you, and that grows into purple on the far hilltops.
      By the time we reached the canyon the sun was riding high and pouring its
      rays full into all the deep nooks where the shadows mostly lay.
    </p>
    <p>
      There were no shadows to-day, except such as the trees cast upon the green
      moss beds and the black rocks. The tops of the tall elms were sere and
      rusty, but the leaves of the rugged oaks that fringed the canyon's lips
      shone a rich and glossy brown. All down the sides the poplars and delicate
      birches, pale yellow, but sometimes flushing into orange and red, stood
      shimmering in the golden light, while here and there the broad-spreading,
      feathery sumachs made great splashes of brilliant crimson upon the yellow
      and gold. Down in the bottom stood the cedars and the balsams, still
      green. We stood some moments silently gazing into this tangle of
      interlacing boughs and shimmering leaves, all glowing in yellow light,
      then Lady Charlotte broke the silence in tones soft and reverent as if she
      stood in a great cathedral.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And this is Gwen's canyon!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, but she never sees it now,&rdquo; I said, for I could never ride through
      without thinking of the child to whose heart this was so dear, but whose
      eyes never rested upon it. Lady Charlotte made no reply, and we took the
      trail that wound down into this maze of mingling colors and lights and
      shadows. Everywhere lay the fallen leaves, brown and yellow and gold;&mdash;everywhere
      on our trail, on the green mosses and among the dead ferns. And as we
      rode, leaves fluttered down from the trees above silently through the
      tangled boughs, and lay with the others on moss and rock and beaten trail.
    </p>
    <p>
      The flowers were all gone; but the Little Swan sang as ever its
      many-voiced song, as it flowed in pools and eddies and cascades, with here
      and there a golden leaf upon its black waters. Ah! how often in weary,
      dusty days these sights and sounds and silences have come to me and
      brought my heart rest!
    </p>
    <p>
      As we began to climb up into the open, I glanced at my companion's face.
      The canyon had done its work with her as with all who loved it. The touch
      of pride that was the habit of her face was gone, and in its place rested
      the earnest wonder of a little child, while in her eyes lay the canyon's
      tender glow. And with this face she looked in upon Gwen.
    </p>
    <p>
      And Gwen, who had been waiting for her, forgot all her nervous fear, and
      with hands outstretched, cried out in welcome:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I'm so glad! You've seen it and I know you love it! My canyon, you
      know!&rdquo; she went on, answering Lady Charlotte's mystified look.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, dear child,&rdquo; said Lady Charlotte, bending over the pale face with
      its halo of golden hair, &ldquo;I love it.&rdquo; But she could get no further, for
      her eyes were full of tears. Gwen gazed up into the beautiful face,
      wondering at her silence, and then said gently:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tell me how it looks to-day! The Pilot always shows it to me. Do you
      know,&rdquo; she added, thoughtfully, &ldquo;The Pilot looks like it himself. He makes
      me think of it, and&mdash;and&mdash;&rdquo; she went on shyly, &ldquo;you do, too.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      By this time Lady Charlotte was kneeling by the couch, smoothing the
      beautiful hair and gently touching the face so pale and lined with pain.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is a great honor, truly,&rdquo; she said brightly through her tears&mdash;&ldquo;to
      be like your canyon and like your Pilot, too.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Gwen nodded, but she was not to be denied.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tell me how it looks to-day,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;I want to see it. Oh, I want to
      see it!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Lady Charlotte was greatly moved by the yearning in the voice, but,
      controlling herself, she said gaily:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I can't show it to you as your Pilot can, but I'll tell you what I
      saw.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Turn me where I can see,&rdquo; said Gwen to me, and I wheeled her toward the
      window and raised her up so that she could look down the trail toward the
      canyon's mouth.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now,&rdquo; she said, after the pain of the lifting had passed, &ldquo;tell me,
      please.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then Lady Charlotte set the canyon before her in rich and radiant
      coloring, while Gwen listened, gazing down upon the trail to where the elm
      tops could be seen, rusty and sere.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, it is lovely!&rdquo; said Gwen, &ldquo;and I see it so well. It is all there
      before me when I look through my window.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But Lady Charlotte looked at her, wondering to see her bright smile, and
      at last she could not help the question:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But don't you weary to see it with your own eyes?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Gwen gently, &ldquo;often I want and want it, oh, so much!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And then, Gwen, dear, how can you bear it?&rdquo; Her voice was eager and
      earnest. &ldquo;Tell me, Gwen. I have heard all about your canyon flowers, but I
      can't understand how the fretting and the pain went away.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Gwen looked at her first in amazement, and then in dawning understanding.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have you a canyon, too?&rdquo; she asked, gravely.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lady Charlotte paused a moment, then nodded. It did appear strange to me
      that she should break down her proud reserve and open her heart to this
      child.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And there are no flowers, Gwen, not one,&rdquo; she said rather bitterly, &ldquo;nor
      sun nor seeds nor soil, I fear.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, if The Pilot were here, he would tell you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      At this point, feeling that they would rather be alone, I excused myself
      on the pretext of looking after the horses.
    </p>
    <p>
      What they talked of during the next hour I never knew, but when I returned
      to the room Lady Charlotte was reading slowly and with perplexed face to
      Gwen out of her mother's Bible the words &ldquo;for the suffering of death,
      crowned with glory and honor.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You see even for Him, suffering,&rdquo; Gwen said eagerly, &ldquo;but I can't
      explain. The Pilot will make it clear.&rdquo; Then the talk ended.
    </p>
    <p>
      We had lunch with Gwen&mdash;bannocks and fresh sweet milk and blueberries&mdash;and
      after an hour of gay fun we came away.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lady Charlotte kissed her tenderly as she bade Gwen good-by.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You must let me come again and sit at your window,&rdquo; she said, smiling
      down upon the wan face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I shall watch for you. How good that will be!&rdquo; cried Gwen,
      delightedly. &ldquo;How many come to see me! You make five.&rdquo; Then she added,
      softly: &ldquo;You will write your letter.&rdquo; But Lady Charlotte shook her head.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I can't do that, I fear,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;but I shall think of it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It was a bright face that looked out upon us through the open window as we
      rode down the trail. Just before we took the dip into the canyon, I turned
      to wave my hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Gwen's friends always wave from here,&rdquo; I said, wheeling my bronco.
    </p>
    <p>
      Again and again Lady Charlotte waved her handkerchief.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How beautiful, but how wonderful!&rdquo; she said as if to herself. &ldquo;Truly, HER
      canyon is full of flowers.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is quite beyond me,&rdquo; I answered. &ldquo;The Pilot may explain.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is there anything your Pilot can't do?&rdquo; said Lady Charlotte.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Try him,&rdquo; I ventured.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I mean to,&rdquo; she replied, &ldquo;but I cannot bring anyone to my canyon, I
      fear,&rdquo; she added in an uncertain voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      As I left her at her door she thanked me with courteous grace.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have done a great deal for me,&rdquo; she said, giving me her hand. &ldquo;It has
      been a beautiful, a wonderful day.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      When I told the Pilot all the day's doings, he burst out:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What a stupid and self-righteous fool I have been! I never thought there
      could be any canyon in her life. How short our sight is!&rdquo; and all that
      night I could get almost no words from him.
    </p>
    <p>
      That was the first of many visits to Gwen. Not a week passed but Lady
      Charlotte took the trail to the Meredith ranch and spent an hour at Gwen's
      window. Often The Pilot found her there. But though they were always
      pleasant hours to him, he would come home in great trouble about Lady
      Charlotte.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She is perfectly charming and doing Gwen no end of good, but she is proud
      as an archangel. Has had an awful break with her family at home, and it is
      spoiling her life. She told me so much, but she will allow no one to touch
      the affair.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But one day we met her riding toward the village. As we drew near, she
      drew up her horse and held up a letter.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Home!&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;I wrote it to-day, and I must get it off immediately.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Pilot understood her at once, but he only said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good!&rdquo; but with such emphasis that we both laughed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I hope so,&rdquo; she said with the red beginning to show in her cheek. &ldquo;I
      have dropped some seed into my canyon.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think I see the flowers beginning to spring,&rdquo; said The Pilot.
    </p>
    <p>
      She shook her head doubtfully and replied:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I shall ride up and sit with Gwen at her window.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do,&rdquo; replied The Pilot, &ldquo;the light is good there. Wonderful things are to
      be seen through Gwen's window.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Lady Charlotte softly. &ldquo;Dear Gwen!&mdash;but I fear it is
      often made bright with tears.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      As she spoke she wheeled her horse and cantered off, for her own tears
      were not far away. I followed her in thought up the trail winding through
      the round-topped hills and down through the golden lights of the canyon
      and into Gwen's room. I could see the pale face, with its golden aureole,
      light up and glow, as they sat before the window while Lady Charlotte
      would tell her how Gwen's Canyon looked to-day and how in her own bleak
      canyon there was the sign of flowers.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XX
    </h2>
    <h3>
      HOW BILL FAVORED &ldquo;HOME-GROWN INDUSTRIES&rdquo;
     </h3>
    <p>
      The building of the Swan Creek Church made a sensation in the country, and
      all the more that Bronco Bill was in command.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When I put up money I stay with the game,&rdquo; he announced; and stay he did,
      to the great benefit of the work and to the delight of The Pilot, who was
      wearing his life out in trying to do several men's work. It was Bill that
      organized the gangs for hauling stone for the foundation and logs for the
      walls. It was Bill that assigned the various jobs to those volunteering
      service. To Robbie Muir and two stalwart Glengarry men from the Ottawa
      lumber region, who knew all about the broadaxe, he gave the hewing down of
      the logs that formed the walls. And when they had done, Bill declared they
      were &ldquo;better 'an a sawmill.&rdquo; It was Bill, too, that did the financing, and
      his passage with Williams, the storekeeper from &ldquo;the other side&rdquo; who dealt
      in lumber and building material, was such as established forever Bill's
      reputation in finance.
    </p>
    <p>
      With The Pilot's plans in his hands he went to Williams, seizing a time
      when the store was full of men after their mail matter.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What do you think ov them plans?&rdquo; he asked innocently.
    </p>
    <p>
      Williams was voluble with opinions and criticism and suggestions, all of
      which were gratefully, even humbly received.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Kind ov hard to figger out jest how much lumber 'll go into the shack,&rdquo;
       said Bill; &ldquo;ye see the logs makes a difference.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      To Williams the thing was simplicity itself, and, after some figuring, he
      handed Bill a complete statement of the amount of lumber of all kinds that
      would be required.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now, what would that there come to?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Williams named his figure, and then Bill entered upon negotiations.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I aint no man to beat down prices. No, sir, I say give a man his figger.
      Of course, this here aint my funeral; besides, bein' a Gospel shop, the
      price naterally would be different.&rdquo; To this the boys all assented and
      Williams looked uncomfortable.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In fact,&rdquo; and Bill adopted his public tone to Hi's admiration and joy,
      &ldquo;this here's a public institooshun&rdquo; (this was Williams' own thunder),
      &ldquo;condoocin' to the good of the community&rdquo; (Hi slapped his thigh and
      squirted half way across the store to signify his entire approval), &ldquo;and I
      cherish the opinion&rdquo;&mdash;(delighted chuckle from Hi)&mdash;&ldquo;that public
      men are interested in this concern.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That's so! Right you are!&rdquo; chorused the boys gravely.
    </p>
    <p>
      Williams agreed, but declared he had thought of all this in making his
      calculation. But seeing it was a church, and the first church and their
      own church, he would make a cut, which he did after more figuring. Bill
      gravely took the slip of paper and put it into his pocket without a word.
      By the end of the week, having in the meantime ridden into town and
      interviewed the dealers there, Bill sauntered into the store and took up
      his position remote from Williams.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You'll be wanting that sheeting, won't you, next week, Bill?&rdquo; said
      Williams.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What sheetin' 's that?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, for the church. Aint the logs up?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, that's so. I was just goin' to see the boys here about gettin' it
      hauled,&rdquo; said Bill.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hauled!&rdquo; said Williams, in amazed indignation. &ldquo;Aint you goin' to stick
      to your deal?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I generally make it my custom to stick to my deals,&rdquo; said Bill, looking
      straight at Williams.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, what about your deal with me last Monday night?&rdquo; said Williams,
      angrily.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let's see. Last Monday night,&rdquo; said Bill, apparently thinking back;
      &ldquo;can't say as I remember any pertickler deal. Any ov you fellers
      remember?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      No one could recall any deal.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You don't remember getting any paper from me, I suppose?&rdquo; said Williams,
      sarcastically.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Paper! Why, I believe I've got that there paper onto my person at this
      present moment,&rdquo; said Bill, diving into his pocket and drawing out
      Williams' estimate. He spent a few moments in careful scrutiny.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There ain't no deal onto this as I can see,&rdquo; said Bill, gravely passing
      the paper to the boys, who each scrutinized it and passed it on with a
      shake of the head or a remark as to the absence of any sign of a deal.
      Williams changed his tone. For his part, he was indifferent in the matter.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then Bill made him an offer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ov course, I believe in supportin' home-grown industries, and if you can
      touch my figger I'd be uncommonly glad to give you the contract.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But Bill's figure, which was quite fifty per cent. lower than Williams'
      best offer, was rejected as quite impossible.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thought I'd make you the offer,&rdquo; said Bill, carelessly, &ldquo;seein' as you're
      institootin' the trade and the boys here 'll all be buildin' more or less,
      and I believe in standin' up for local trades and manufactures.&rdquo; There
      were nods of approval on all sides, and Williams was forced to accept, for
      Bill began arranging with the Hill brothers and Hi to make an early start
      on Monday. It was a great triumph, but Bill displayed no sign of elation;
      he was rather full of sympathy for Williams, and eager to help on the
      lumber business as a local &ldquo;institooshun.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Second in command in the church building enterprise stood Lady Charlotte,
      and under her labored the Hon. Fred, The Duke, and, indeed, all the
      company of the Noble Seven. Her home became the centre of a new type of
      social life. With exquisite tact, and much was needed for this kind of
      work, she drew the bachelors from their lonely shacks and from their wild
      carousals, and gave them a taste of the joys of a pure home-life, the
      first they had had since leaving the old homes years ago. And then she
      made them work for the church with such zeal and diligence that her
      husband and The Duke declared that ranching had become quite an incidental
      interest since the church-building had begun. But The Pilot went about
      with a radiant look on his pale face, while Bill gave it forth as his
      opinion, &ldquo;though she was a leetle high in the action, she could hit an
      uncommon gait.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      With such energy did Bill push the work of construction that by the first
      of December the church stood roofed, sheeted, floored and ready for
      windows, doors and ceiling, so that The Pilot began to hope that he should
      see the desire of his heart fulfilled&mdash;the church of Swan Creek open
      for divine service on Christmas Day.
    </p>
    <p>
      During these weeks there was more than church-building going on, for while
      the days were given to the shaping of logs, and the driving of nails and
      the planing of boards, the long winter evenings were spent in talk around
      the fire in my shack, where The Pilot for some months past had made his
      home and where Bill, since the beginning of the church building, had come
      &ldquo;to camp.&rdquo; Those were great nights for The Pilot and Bill, and, indeed,
      for me, too, and the other boys, who, after a day's work on the church,
      were always brought in by Bill or The Pilot.
    </p>
    <p>
      Great nights for us all they were. After bacon and beans and bannocks, and
      occasionally potatoes, and rarely a pudding, with coffee, rich and
      steaming, to wash all down, pipes would follow, and then yarns of
      adventures, possible and impossible, all exciting and wonderful, and all
      received with the greatest credulity.
    </p>
    <p>
      If, however, the powers of belief were put to too great a strain by a tale
      of more than ordinary marvel, Bill would follow with one of such utter
      impossibility that the company would feel that the limit had been reached,
      and the yarns would cease. But after the first week most of the time was
      given to The Pilot, who would read to us of the deeds of the mighty men of
      old, who had made and wrecked empires.
    </p>
    <p>
      What happy nights they were to those cowboys, who had been cast up like
      driftwood upon this strange and lonely shore! Some of them had never known
      what it was to have a thought beyond the work and sport of the day. And
      the world into which The Pilot was ushering them was all new and wonderful
      to them. Happy nights, without a care, but that The Pilot would not get
      the ghastly look out of his face, and laughed at the idea of going away
      till the church was built. And, indeed, we would all have sorely missed
      him, and so he stayed.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XXI.
    </h2>
    <h3>
      HOW BILL HIT THE TRAIL
    </h3>
    <p>
      When &ldquo;the crowd&rdquo; was with us The Pilot read us all sorts of tales of
      adventures in all lands by heroes of all ages, but when we three sat
      together by our fire The Pilot would always read us tales of the heroes of
      sacred story, and these delighted Bill more than those of any of the
      ancient empires of the past. He had his favorites. Abraham, Moses, Joshua,
      Gideon, never failed to arouse his admiration. But Jacob was to him always
      &ldquo;a mean cuss,&rdquo; and David he could not appreciate. Most of all he admired
      Moses and the Apostle Paul, whom he called &ldquo;that little chap.&rdquo; But, when
      the reading was about the One Great Man that moved majestic amid the
      gospel stories, Bill made no comments; He was too high for approval.
    </p>
    <p>
      By and by Bill began to tell these tales to the boys, and one night, when
      a quiet mood had fallen upon the company, Bill broke the silence.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Say, Pilot, where was it that the little chap got mixed up into that
      riot?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Riot!&rdquo; said The Pilot.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes; you remember when he stood off the whole gang from the stairs?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, yes, at Jerusalem!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, that's the spot. Perhaps you would read that to the boys. Good yarn!
      Little chap, you know, stood up and told 'em they were all sorts of
      blanked thieves and cut-throats, and stood 'em off. Played it alone, too.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Most of the boys failed to recognize the story in its new dress. There was
      much interest.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who was the duck? Who was the gang? What was the row about?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The Pilot here'll tell you. If you'd kind o' give 'em a lead before you
      begin, they'd catch on to the yarn better.&rdquo; This last to The Pilot, who
      was preparing to read.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, it was at Jerusalem,&rdquo; began The Pilot, when Bill interrupted:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If I might remark, perhaps it might help the boys on to the trail mebbe,
      if you'd tell 'em how the little chap struck his new gait.&rdquo; So he
      designated the Apostle's conversion.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then The Pilot introduced the Apostle with some formality to the company,
      describing with such vivid touches his life and early training, his sudden
      wrench from all he held dear, under the stress of a new conviction, his
      magnificent enthusiasm and courage, his tenderness and patience, that I
      was surprised to find myself regarding him as a sort of hero, and the boys
      were all ready to back him against any odds. As The Pilot read the story
      of the Arrest at Jerusalem, stopping now and then to picture the scene, we
      saw it all and were in the thick of it. The raging crowd hustling and
      beating the life out of the brave little man, the sudden thrust of the
      disciplined Roman guard through the mass, the rescue, the pause on the
      stairway, the calm face of the little hero beckoning for a hearing, the
      quieting of the frantic, frothing mob, the fearless speech&mdash;all
      passed before us. The boys were thrilled.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good stuff, eh?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ain't he a daisy?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Daisy! He's a whole sunflower patch!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; drawled Bill, highly appreciating their marks of approval. &ldquo;That's
      what I call a partickler fine character of a man. There ain't no manner of
      insecks on to him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You bet!&rdquo; said Hi.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I say,&rdquo; broke in one of the boys, who was just emerging from the
      tenderfoot stage, &ldquo;o' course that's in the Bible, ain't it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Pilot assented.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, how do you know it's true?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Pilot was proceeding to elaborate his argument when Bill cut in
      somewhat more abruptly than was his wont.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Look here, young feller!&rdquo; Bill's voice was in the tone of command. The
      man looked as he was bid. &ldquo;How do you know anything's true? How do you
      know The Pilot here's true when he speaks? Can't you tell by the feel? You
      know by the sound of his voice, don't you?&rdquo; Bill paused and the young
      fellow agreed readily.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well how do you know a blanked son of a she jackass when you see him?&rdquo;
       Again Bill paused. There was no reply.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said Bill, resuming his deliberate drawl. &ldquo;I'll give you the
      information without extra charge. It's by the sound he makes when he opens
      his blanked jaw.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But,&rdquo; went on the young skeptic, nettled at the laugh that went round,
      &ldquo;that don't prove anything. You know,&rdquo; turning to The Pilot, &ldquo;that there
      are heaps of people who don't believe the Bible.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Pilot nodded.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Some of the smartest, best-educated men are agnostics,&rdquo; proceeded the
      young man, warming to his theme, and failing to notice the stiffening of
      Bill's lank figure. &ldquo;I don't know but what I am one myself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That so?&rdquo; said Bill, with sudden interest.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I guess so,&rdquo; was the modest reply.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Got it bad?&rdquo; went on Bill, with a note of anxiety in his tone.
    </p>
    <p>
      But the young man turned to The Pilot and tried to open a fresh argument.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Whatever he's got,&rdquo; said Bill to the others, in a mild voice, &ldquo;it's
      spoilin' his manners.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; went on Bill, meditatively, after the slight laugh had died, &ldquo;it's
      ruinin' to the judgment. He don't seem to know when he interferes with the
      game. Pity, too.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Still the argument went on.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Seems as if he ought to take somethin',&rdquo; said Bill, in a voice
      suspiciously mild. &ldquo;What would you suggest?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A walk, mebbe!&rdquo; said Hi, in delighted expectation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I hold the opinion that you have mentioned an uncommonly vallable remedy,
      better'n Pain Killer almost.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Bill rose languidly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I say,&rdquo; he drawled, tapping the young fellow, &ldquo;it appears to me a little
      walk would perhaps be good, mebbe.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All right, wait till I get my cap,&rdquo; was the unsuspecting reply.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't think perhaps you won't need it, mebbe. I cherish the opinion
      you'll, perhaps, be warm enough.&rdquo; Bill's voice had unconsciously passed
      into a sterner tone. Hi was on his feet and at the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This here interview is private AND confidential,&rdquo; said Bill to his
      partner.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Exactly,&rdquo; said Hi, opening the door. At this the young fellow, who was a
      strapping six-footer, but soft and flabby, drew back and refused to go. He
      was too late. Bill's grip was on his collar and out they went into the
      snow, and behind them Hi closed the door. In vain the young fellow
      struggled to wrench himself free from the hands that had him by the
      shoulder and the back of the neck. I took it all in from the window. He
      might have been a boy for all the effect his plungings had upon the long,
      sinewy arms that gripped him so fiercely. After a minute's furious
      struggle the young fellow stood quiet, when Bill suddenly shifted his grip
      from the shoulder to the seat of his buckskin trousers. Then began a
      series of evolutions before the house&mdash;up and down, forward and back,
      which the unfortunate victim, with hands wildly clutching at empty air,
      was quite powerless to resist till he was brought up panting and gasping,
      subdued, to a standstill.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'll larn you agnostics and several other kinds of ticks,&rdquo; said Bill, in
      a terrible voice, his drawl lengthening perceptibly. &ldquo;Come round here,
      will you, and shove your blanked second-handed trash down our throats?&rdquo;
       Bill paused to get words; then, bursting out in rising wrath:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There ain't no sootable words for sich conduct. By the livin' Jeminy&mdash;&rdquo;
       He suddenly swung his prisoner off his feet, lifted him bodily, and held
      him over his head at arm's length. &ldquo;I've a notion to&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don't! don't! for Heaven's sake!&rdquo; cried the struggling wretch, &ldquo;I'll stop
      it! I will!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Bill at once lowered him and set him on his feet.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All right! Shake!&rdquo; he said, holding out his hand, which the other took
      with caution.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was a remarkably sudden conversion and lasting in its effects. There
      was no more agnosticism in the little group that gathered around The Pilot
      for the nightly reading.
    </p>
    <p>
      The interest in the reading kept growing night by night.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Seems as if The Pilot was gittin' in his work,&rdquo; said Bill to me; and
      looking at the grave, eager faces, I agreed. He was getting in his work
      with Bill, too; though perhaps Bill did not know it. I remember one night,
      when the others had gone, The Pilot was reading to us the Parable of the
      Talents, Bill was particularly interested in the servant who failed in his
      duty.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ornery cuss, eh?&rdquo; he remarked; &ldquo;and gall, too, eh? Served him blamed well
      right, in my opinion!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But when the practical bearing of the parable became clear to him, after
      long silence, he said, slowly:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, that there seems to indicate that it's about time for me to get a
      rustle on.&rdquo; Then, after another silence, he said, hesitatingly, &ldquo;This here
      church-buildin' business now, do you think that'll perhaps count, mebbe? I
      guess not, eh? 'Tain't much, o' course, anyway.&rdquo; Poor Bill, he was like a
      child, and The Pilot handled him with a mother's touch.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What are you best at, Bill?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bronco-bustin' and cattle,&rdquo; said Bill, wonderingly; &ldquo;that's my line.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, Bill, my line is preaching just now, and piloting, you know.&rdquo; The
      Pilot's smile was like a sunbeam on a rainy day, for there were tears in
      his eyes and voice. &ldquo;And we have just got to be faithful. You see what he
      says: 'Well done, good and FAITHFUL servant. Thou hast been FAITHFUL.'&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Bill was puzzled.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Faithful!&rdquo; he repeated. &ldquo;Does that mean with the cattle, perhaps?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, that's just it, Bill, and with everything else that comes your way.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And Bill never forgot that lesson, for I heard him, with a kind of quiet
      enthusiasm, giving it to Hi as a great find. &ldquo;Now, I call that a fair
      deal,&rdquo; he said to his friend; &ldquo;gives every man a show. No cards up the
      sleeve.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That's so,&rdquo; was Hi's thoughtful reply; &ldquo;distributes the trumps.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Somehow Bill came to be regarded as an authority upon questions of
      religion and morals. No one ever accused him of &ldquo;gettin' religion.&rdquo; He
      went about his work in his slow, quiet way, but he was always sharing his
      discoveries with &ldquo;the boys.&rdquo; And if anyone puzzled him with subtleties he
      never rested till he had him face to face with The Pilot. And so it came
      that these two drew to each other with more than brotherly affection. When
      Bill got into difficulty with problems that have vexed the souls of men
      far wiser than he, The Pilot would either disentangle the knots or would
      turn his mind to the verities that stood out sure and clear, and Bill
      would be content.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That's good enough for me,&rdquo; he would say, and his heart would be at rest.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XXII
    </h2>
    <h3>
      HOW THE SWAN CREEK CHURCH WAS OPENED
    </h3>
    <p>
      When, near the end of the year, The Pilot fell sick, Bill nursed him like
      a mother and sent him off for a rest and change to Gwen, forbidding him to
      return till the church was finished and visiting him twice a week. The
      love between the two was most beautiful, and, when I find my heart grow
      hard and unbelieving in men and things, I let my mind wander back to a
      scene that I came upon in front of Gwen's house. These two were standing
      alone in the clear moonlight, Bill with his hand upon The Pilot's
      shoulder, and The Pilot with his arm around Bill's neck.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dear old Bill,&rdquo; The Pilot was saying, &ldquo;dear old Bill,&rdquo; and the voice was
      breaking into a sob. And Bill, standing stiff and straight, looked up at
      the stars, coughed and swallowed hard for some moments, and said, in a
      queer, croaky voice:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Shouldn't wonder if a Chinook would blow up.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Chinook?&rdquo; laughed The Pilot, with a catch in his voice. &ldquo;You dear old
      humbug,&rdquo; and he stood watching till the lank form swayed down into the
      canyon.
    </p>
    <p>
      The day of the church opening came, as all days, however long waited for,
      will come&mdash;a bright, beautiful Christmas Day. The air was still and
      full of frosty light, as if arrested by a voice of command, waiting the
      word to move. The hills lay under their dazzling coverlets, asleep. Back
      of all, the great peaks lifted majestic heads out of the dark forests and
      gazed with calm, steadfast faces upon the white, sunlit world. To-day, as
      the light filled up the cracks that wrinkled their hard faces, they seemed
      to smile, as if the Christmas joy had somehow moved something in their
      old, stony hearts.
    </p>
    <p>
      The people were all there&mdash;farmers, ranchers, cowboys, wives and
      children&mdash;all happy, all proud of their new church, and now all
      expectant, waiting for The Pilot and the Old Timer, who were to drive down
      if The Pilot was fit and were to bring Gwen if the day was fine. As the
      time passed on, Bill, as master of ceremonies, began to grow uneasy. Then
      Indian Joe appeared and handed a note to Bill. He read it, grew gray in
      the face and passed it to me. Looking, I saw in poor, wavering lines the
      words, &ldquo;Dear Bill. Go on with the opening. Sing the Psalm, you know the
      one, and say a prayer, and oh, come to me quick, Bill. Your Pilot.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Bill gradually pulled himself together, announced in a strange voice, &ldquo;The
      Pilot can't come,&rdquo; handed me the Psalm, and said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Make them sing.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It was that grand Psalm for all hill peoples, &ldquo;I to the hills will lift
      mine eyes,&rdquo; and with wondering faces they sang the strong, steadying
      words. After the Psalm was over the people sat and waited, Bill looked at
      the Hon. Fred Ashley, then at Robbie Muir, then said to me in a low voice:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Kin you make a prayer?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I shook my head, ashamed as I did so of my cowardice.
    </p>
    <p>
      Again Bill paused, then said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The Pilot says there's got to be a prayer. Kin anyone make one?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Again dead, solemn silence.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then Hi, who was near the back, said, coming to his partner's help:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What's the matter with you trying, yourself, Bill?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The red began to come up in Bill's white face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'Taint in my line. But The Pilot says there's got to be a prayer, and I'm
      going to stay with the game.&rdquo; Then, leaning on the pulpit, he said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let's pray,&rdquo; and began:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;God Almighty, I ain't no good at this, and perhaps you'll understand if I
      don't put things right.&rdquo; Then a pause followed, during which I heard some
      of the women beginning to sob.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What I want to say,&rdquo; Bill went on, &ldquo;is, we're mighty glad about this
      church, which we know it's you and The Pilot that's worked it. And we're
      all glad to chip in.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then again he paused, and, looking up, I saw his hard, gray face working
      and two tears stealing down his cheeks. Then he started again:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But about The Pilot&mdash;I don't want to persoom&mdash;but if you don't
      mind, we'd like to have him stay&mdash;in fact, don't see how we kin do
      without him&mdash;look at all the boys here; he's just getting his work in
      and is bringin' 'em right along, and, God Almighty, if you take him away
      it might be a good thing for himself, but for us&mdash;oh, God,&rdquo; the voice
      quivered and was silent &ldquo;Amen.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then someone, I think it must have been the Lady Charlotte, began: &ldquo;Our
      Father,&rdquo; and all joined that could join, to the end. For a few moments
      Bill stood up, looking at them silently. Then, as if remembering his duty,
      he said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This here church is open. Excuse me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He stood at the door, gave a word of direction to Hi, who had followed him
      out, and leaping on his bronco shook him out into a hard gallop.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Swan Creek Church was opened. The form of service may not have been
      correct, but, if great love counts for anything and appealing faith, then
      all that was necessary was done.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XXIII
    </h2>
    <h3>
      THE PILOT'S LAST PORT
    </h3>
    <p>
      In the old times a funeral was regarded in the Swan Creek country as a
      kind of solemn festivity. In those days, for the most part, men died in
      their boots and were planted with much honor and loyal libation. There was
      often neither shroud nor coffin, and in the Far West many a poor fellow
      lies as he fell, wrapped in his own or his comrade's blanket.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was the manager of the X L Company's ranch that introduced crape. The
      occasion was the funeral of one of the ranch cowboys, killed by his
      bronco, but when the pall-bearers and mourners appeared with bands and
      streamers of crape, this was voted by the majority as &ldquo;too gay.&rdquo; That
      circumstance alone was sufficient to render that funeral famous, but it
      was remembered, too, as having shocked the proprieties in another and more
      serious manner. No one would be so narrow-minded as to object to the
      custom of the return procession falling into a series of horse-races of
      the wildest description, and ending up at Latour's in a general riot. But
      to race with the corpse was considered bad form. The &ldquo;corpse-driver,&rdquo; as
      he was called, could hardly be blamed on this occasion. His acknowledged
      place was at the head of the procession, and it was a point of honor that
      that place should be retained. The fault clearly lay with the driver of
      the X L ranch sleigh, containing the mourners (an innovation, by the way),
      who felt aggrieved that Hi Kendal, driving the Ashley team with the
      pall-bearers (another innovation), should be given the place of honor next
      the corpse. The X L driver wanted to know what, in the name of all that
      was black and blue, the Ashley Ranch had to do with the funeral? Whose was
      that corpse, anyway? Didn't it belong to the X L ranch? Hi, on the other
      hand, contended that the corpse was in charge of the pall-bearers. &ldquo;It was
      their duty to see it right to the grave, and if they were not on hand, how
      was it goin' to get there? They didn't expect it would git up and get
      there by itself, did they? Hi didn't want no blanked mourners foolin'
      round that corp till it was properly planted; after that they might git in
      their work.&rdquo; But the X L driver could not accept this view, and at the
      first opportunity slipped past Hi and his pall-bearers and took the place
      next the sleigh that carried the coffin. It is possible that Hi might have
      borne with this affront and loss of position with even mind, but the
      jeering remarks of the mourners as they slid past triumphantly could not
      be endured, and the next moment the three teams were abreast in a race as
      for dear life. The corpse-driver, having the advantage of the beaten
      track, soon left the other two behind running neck and neck for second
      place, which was captured finally by Hi and maintained to the grave side,
      in spite of many attempts on the part of the X L's. The whole proceeding,
      however, was considered quite improper, and at Latour's, that night, after
      full and bibulous discussion, it was agreed that the corpse-driver fairly
      distributed the blame. &ldquo;For his part,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;he knew he hadn't ought
      to make no corp git any such move on, but he wasn't goin' to see that
      there corp take second place at his own funeral. Not if he could help it.
      And as for the others, he thought that the pall-bearers had a blanked
      sight more to do with the plantin' than them giddy mourners.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But when they gathered at the Meredith ranch to carry out The Pilot to his
      grave it was felt that the Foothill Country was called to a new
      experience. They were all there. The men from the Porcupine and from
      beyond the Fort, the Police with the Inspector in command, all the farmers
      for twenty miles around, and of course all the ranchers and cowboys of the
      Swan Creek country. There was no effort at repression. There was no need,
      for in the cowboys, for the first time in their experience, there was no
      heart for fun. And as they rode up and hitched their horses to the fence,
      or drove their sleighs into the yard and took off the bells, there was no
      loud-voiced salutation, no guying nor chaffing, but with silent nod they
      took their places in the crowd about the door or passed into the kitchen.
    </p>
    <p>
      The men from the Porcupine could not quite understand the gloomy silence.
      It was something unprecedented in a country where men laughed all care to
      scorn and saluted death with a nod. But they were quick to read signs, and
      with characteristic courtesy they fell in with the mood they could not
      understand. There is no man living so quick to feel your mood, and so
      ready to adapt himself to it, as is the true Westerner.
    </p>
    <p>
      This was the day of the cowboy's grief. To the rest of the community The
      Pilot was preacher; to them he was comrade and friend. They had been slow
      to admit him to their confidence, but steadily he had won his place with
      them, till within the last few months they had come to count him as of
      themselves. He had ridden the range with them; he had slept in their
      shacks and cooked his meals on their tin stoves; and, besides, he was
      Bill's chum. That alone was enough to give him a right to all they owned.
      He was theirs, and they were only beginning to take full pride in him when
      he passed out from them, leaving an emptiness in their life new and
      unexplained. No man in that country had ever shown concern for them, nor
      had it occurred to them that any man could, till The Pilot came. It took
      them long to believe that the interest he showed in them was genuine and
      not simply professional. Then, too, from a preacher they had expected
      chiefly pity, warning, rebuke. The Pilot astonished them by giving them
      respect, admiration, and open-hearted affection. It was months before they
      could get over their suspicion that he was humbugging them. When once they
      did, they gave him back without knowing it all the trust and love of their
      big, generous hearts. He had made this world new to some of them, and to
      all had given glimpses of the next. It was no wonder that they stood in
      dumb groups about the house where the man, who had done all this for them
      and had been all this to them lay dead.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was no demonstration of grief. The Duke was in command, and his
      quiet, firm voice, giving directions, helped all to self-control. The
      women who were gathered in the middle room were weeping quietly. Bill was
      nowhere to be seen, but near the inner door sat Gwen in her chair, with
      Lady Charlotte beside her, holding her hand. Her face, worn with long
      suffering, was pale, but serene as the morning sky, and with not a trace
      of tears. As my eye caught hers, she beckoned me to her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where's Bill?&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Bring him in.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I found him at the back of the house.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Aren't you coming in, Bill?&rdquo; I said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No; I guess there's plenty without me,&rdquo; he said, in his slow way.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You'd better come in; the service is going to begin,&rdquo; I urged.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don't seem as if I cared for to hear anythin' much. I ain't much used to
      preachin', anyway,&rdquo; said Bill, with careful indifference, but he added to
      himself, &ldquo;except his, of course.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come in, Bill,&rdquo; I urged. &ldquo;It will look queer, you know,&rdquo; but Bill
      replied:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I guess I'll not bother,&rdquo; adding, after a pause: &ldquo;You see, there's them
      wimmin turnin' on the waterworks, and like as not they'd swamp me sure.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That's so,&rdquo; said Hi, who was standing near, in silent sympathy with his
      friend's grief.
    </p>
    <p>
      I reported to Gwen, who answered in her old imperious way, &ldquo;Tell him I
      want him.&rdquo; I took Bill the message.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why didn't you say so before?&rdquo; he said, and, starting up, he passed into
      the house and took up his position behind Gwen's chair. Opposite, and
      leaning against the door, stood The Duke, with a look of quiet earnestness
      on his handsome face. At his side stood the Hon. Fred Ashley, and behind
      him the Old Timer, looking bewildered and woe-stricken. The Pilot had
      filled a large place in the old man's life. The rest of the men stood
      about the room and filled the kitchen beyond, all quiet, solemn, sad.
    </p>
    <p>
      In Gwen's room, the one farthest in, lay The Pilot, stately and beautiful
      under the magic touch of death. And as I stood and looked down upon the
      quiet face I saw why Gwen shed no tear, but carried a look of serene
      triumph. She had read the face aright. The lines of weariness that had
      been growing so painfully clear the last few months were smoothed out, the
      look of care was gone, and in place of weariness and care, was the proud
      smile of victory and peace. He had met his foe and was surprised to find
      his terror gone.
    </p>
    <p>
      The service was beautiful in its simplicity. The minister, The Pilot's
      chief, had come out from town to take charge. He was rather a little man,
      but sturdy and well set. His face was burnt and seared with the suns and
      frosts he had braved for years. Still in the prime of his manhood, his
      hair and beard were grizzled and his face deep-lined, for the toils and
      cares of a pioneer missionary's life are neither few nor light. But out of
      his kindly blue eye looked the heart of a hero, and as he spoke to us we
      felt the prophet's touch and caught a gleam of the prophet's fire.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have fought the fight,&rdquo; he read. The ring in his voice lifted up all
      our heads, and, as he pictured to us the life of that battered hero who
      had written these words, I saw Bill's eyes begin to gleam and his lank
      figure straighten out its lazy angles. Then he turned the leaves quickly
      and read again, &ldquo;Let not your heart be troubled . . . in my father's house
      are many mansions.&rdquo; His voice took a lower, sweeter tone; he looked over
      our heads, and for a few moments spoke of the eternal hope. Then he came
      back to us, and, looking round into the faces turned so eagerly to him,
      talked to us of The Pilot&mdash;how at the first he had sent him to us
      with fear and trembling&mdash;he was so young&mdash;but how he had come to
      trust in him and to rejoice in his work, and to hope much from his life.
      Now it was all over; but he felt sure his young friend had not given his
      life in vain. He paused as he looked from one to the other, till his eyes
      rested on Gwen's face. I was startled, as I believe he was, too, at the
      smile that parted her lips, so evidently saying: &ldquo;Yes, but how much better
      I know than you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; he went on, after a pause, answering her smile, &ldquo;you all know
      better than I that his work among you will not pass away with his removal,
      but endure while you live,&rdquo; and the smile on Gwen's face grew brighter.
      &ldquo;And now you must not grudge him his reward and his rest . . . and his
      home.&rdquo; And Bill, nodding his head slowly, said under his breath, &ldquo;That's
      so.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then they sang that hymn of the dawning glory of Immanuel's land,&mdash;Lady
      Charlotte playing the organ and The Duke leading with clear, steady voice
      verse after verse. When they came to the last verse the minister made a
      sign and, while they waited, he read the words:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     &ldquo;I've wrestled on towards heaven
      'Gainst storm, and wind, and tide.&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      And so on to that last victorious cry,&mdash;
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     &ldquo;I hail the glory dawning
      In Immanuel's Land.&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      For a moment it looked as if the singing could not go on, for tears were
      on the minister's face and the women were beginning to sob, but The Duke's
      clear, quiet voice caught up the song and steadied them all to the end.
    </p>
    <p>
      After the prayer they all went in and looked at The Pilot's face and
      passed out, leaving behind only those that knew him best. The Duke and the
      Hon. Fred stood looking down upon the quiet face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The country has lost a good man, Duke,&rdquo; said the Hon. Fred. The Duke
      bowed silently. Then Lady Charlotte came and gazed a moment.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dear Pilot,&rdquo; she whispered, her tears falling fast. &ldquo;Dear, dear Pilot!
      Thank God for you! You have done much for me.&rdquo; Then she stooped and kissed
      him on his cold lips and on his forehead.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then Gwen seemed to suddenly waken as from a dream. She turned and,
      looking up in a frightened way, said to Bill hurriedly:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I want to see him again. Carry me!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And Bill gathered her up in his arms and took her in. As they looked down
      upon the dead face with its look of proud peace and touched with the
      stateliness of death, Gwen's fear passed away. But when The Duke made to
      cover the face, Gwen drew a sharp breath and, clinging to Bill, said, with
      a sudden gasp:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, Bill, I can't bear it alone. I'm afraid alone.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She was thinking of the long, weary days of pain before her that she must
      face now without The Pilot's touch and smile and voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Me, too,&rdquo; said Bill, thinking of the days before him. He could have said
      nothing better. Gwen looked in his face a moment, then said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We'll help each other,&rdquo; and Bill, swallowing hard, could only nod his
      head in reply. Once more they looked upon The Pilot, leaning down and
      lingering over him, and then Gwen said quietly:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Take me away, Bill,&rdquo; and Bill carried her into the outer room. Turning
      back I caught a look on The Duke's face so full of grief that I could not
      help showing my amazement. He noticed and said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The best man I ever knew, Connor. He has done something for me too. . . .
      I'd give the world to die like that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then he covered the face.
    </p>
    <p>
      We sat Gwen's window, Bill, with Gwen in his arms, and I watching. Down
      the sloping, snow-covered hill wound the procession of sleighs and
      horsemen, without sound of voice or jingle of bell till, one by one, they
      passed out of our sight and dipped down into the canyon. But we knew every
      step of the winding trail and followed them in fancy through that fairy
      scene of mystic wonderland. We knew how the great elms and the poplars and
      the birches clinging to the snowy sides interlaced their bare boughs into
      a network of bewildering complexity, and how the cedars and balsams and
      spruces stood in the bottom, their dark boughs weighted down with heavy
      white mantles of snow, and how every stump and fallen log and rotting
      stick was made a thing of beauty by the snow that had fallen so gently on
      them in that quiet spot. And we could see the rocks of the canyon sides
      gleam out black from under overhanging snow-banks, and we could hear the
      song of the Swan in its many tones, now under an icy sheet, cooing
      comfortably, and then bursting out into sunlit laughter and leaping into a
      foaming pool, to glide away smoothly murmuring its delight to the white
      banks that curved to kiss the dark water as it fled. And where the flowers
      had been, the violets and the wind-flowers and the clematis and the
      columbine and all the ferns and flowering shrubs, there lay the snow.
      Everywhere the snow, pure, white, and myriad-gemmed, but every flake a
      flower's shroud.
    </p>
    <p>
      Out where the canyon opened to the sunny, sloping prairie, there they
      would lay The Pilot to sleep, within touch of the canyon he loved, with
      all its sleeping things. And there he lies to this time. But Spring has
      come many times to the canyon since that winter day, and has called to the
      sleeping flowers, summoning them forth in merry troops, and ever more and
      more till the canyon ripples with them. And lives are like flowers. In
      dying they abide not alone, but sow themselves and bloom again with each
      returning spring, and ever more and more.
    </p>
    <p>
      For often during the following years, as here and there I came upon one of
      those that companied with us in those Foothill days, I would catch a
      glimpse in word and deed and look of him we called, first in jest, but
      afterwards with true and tender feeling we were not ashamed to own, our
      Sky Pilot.

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.

Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
